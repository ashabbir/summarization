                            CHAPTER I <p>                      Down the Rabbit-Hole <p> 
  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister 
on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had 
peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no 
pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,' 
thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?' <p>  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, 
for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether 
the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble 
of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White 
Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> nor did Alice 
think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to 
itself, `Oh dear!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Let 
me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for, 
you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her 
lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good 
opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to 
listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes, 
that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude 
or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, 
or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to 
say.) <p>  Presently she began again.</span>  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon 
began talking again.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There was not a moment to be lost: 
away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it 
say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late 
it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the 
corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found 
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps 
hanging from the roof.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, 
and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the 
doors of the hall;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `and even if 
my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of 
very little use without my shoulders.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I think I could, if I only 
know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things 
had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few 
things indeed were really impossible.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <p>         *       *       *       *       *       * <p>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <p>  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my 
going out altogether, like a candle.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But it's no 
use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to 
feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to 
find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally 
happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the 
way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, 
that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the 
common way.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <p>         *       *       *       *       *       * <p>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <p> <p> 
                           CHAPTER II <p>                        The Pool of Tears <p> 
  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much 
surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good 
English);</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> --but I must be 
kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the 
way I want to go!</span> won't she 
be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate 
that she was ready to ask help of any one;<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>            `How cheerfully he seems to grin, 
              How neatly spread his claws, 
            And welcome little fishes in 
              With gently smiling jaws!' <p>  `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and 
her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel 
after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little 
house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Tell me that first, and then, if I 
like being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down 
here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a 
sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads 
down!</span>  (Alice had 
been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general 
conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find 
a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in 
the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and 
behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that 
she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine 
feet high.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!' 
(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: 
she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having 
seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a 
mouse--a mouse--O mouse!')  The Mouse looked at her rather 
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little 
eyes, but it said nothing.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `I 
daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the 
Conqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had 
no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she 
began again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in 
her French lesson-book.</span>  `Oh, I beg 
your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the 
poor animal's feelings.  `Would YOU like cats if you were me?' <p>  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone:  `don't be 
angry about it.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> 
She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, 
as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so 
nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and 
she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital 
one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again, 
for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt 
certain it must be really offended.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Don't let me hear 
the name again!' <p>  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the 
subject of conversation.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' 
The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is 
such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Do come back 
again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't 
like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam 
slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice 
thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to 
the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll 
understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.' <p>  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded 
with the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a 
Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious 
creatures.</span>  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the 
shore.  Alice kept her eyes 
anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad 
cold if she did not get dry very soon.  But the insolence of his Normans--"  How are you 
getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it 
spoke. Prizes!' <p>  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand 
in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt 
water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.  `What else have 
you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> 
`What are you thinking of?' <p>  `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly:  `you had got to 
the fifth bend, I think?' <p>  `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You insult me by talking such nonsense!' <p>  `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You're enough to try the 
patience of an oyster!' <p>  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, 
addressing nobody in particular.</span>  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts 
they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I 
wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice 
began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Where CAN I have 
dropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed in a moment that it was 
looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she 
very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were 
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her 
swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and 
the little door, had vanished completely.</span>  Quick, now!'  And Alice was so much frightened 
that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without 
trying to explain the mistake it had made.  I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on 
messages next!'  And she began fancying the sort of thing that 
would happen:  `"Miss Alice!<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Only I don't think,' Alice went 
on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering 
people about like that!' <p>  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with 
a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two 
or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and 
a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when 
her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking- 
glass.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  What WILL become of me?' <p>  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full 
effect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable, 
and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting 
out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `at least there's no room to grow up any more 
HERE.' <p>  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I 
am now?</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and 
she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she 
was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no 
reason to be afraid of it.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice heard it 
say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.' <p>  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she 
fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly 
spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Why, it 
fills the whole window!' <p>  `Sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's an arm for all that.' <p>  `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate:  go and take it 
away!' <p>  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear 
whispers now and then;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What a number of cucumber-frames there 
must be!' thought Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said 
Alice to herself.</span> and 
Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I'll set 
Dinah at you!' <p>  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to 
herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  If they had any 
sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they 
began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A 
barrowful will do, to begin with.' <p>  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> then Alice 
dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run 
over;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> then Alice, thinking it was very 
like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every 
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle 
again;</span> <p>  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she 
leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself 
with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks 
very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice looked all round 
her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see 
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under 
the circumstances.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice 
replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present-- 
at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think 
I must have been changed several times since then.' <p>  `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's 
making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, 
very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.' <p>  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and as Alice could not 
think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in 
a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I've something 
important to say!' <p>  This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back 
again.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but 
at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth 
again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?' <p>  `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to 
herself.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p> 
     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <p>         *       *       *       *       *       * <p>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <p>  `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of 
delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she 
found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could 
see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which 
seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay 
far below her.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Let me alone!' <p>  `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more 
subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every 
way, and nothing seems to suit them!' <p>  `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said 
Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There's no pleasing them!' <p>  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no 
use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!' <p>  `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was 
beginning to see its meaning.</span>  Ugh, Serpent!' <p>  `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I can see you're 
trying to invent something!' <p>  `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she 
remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I suppose you'll be 
telling me next that you never tasted an egg!' <p>  `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very 
truthful child;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `but if they do, why 
then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.' <p>  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent 
for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of 
adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and 
what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a 
serpent?' <p>  `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily;</span>  Alice crouched down among the 
trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled 
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and 
untwist it. and both footmen, 
Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their 
heads.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  For 
instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let 
you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time 
he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.</span>  `That's the 
first question, you know.' <p>  It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I shall sit here,' he 
said, `on and off, for days and days.' <p>  `But what am I to do?' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `and most of 'em do.' <p>  `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, 
feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `and that's a fact.' <p>  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought 
it would be as well to introduce some other subject of 
conversation.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn 
round on its axis--' <p>  `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!' <p>  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant 
to take the hint;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> wow!' <p>  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept 
tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing 
howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:-- <p>        `I speak severely to my boy, 
          I beat him when he sneezes;</span> you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said 
to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer- 
shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all 
directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `IF I 
don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure 
to kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave it 
behind?'  She said the last words out loud, and the little thing 
grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `that's not at all a proper way of expressing 
yourself.' <p>  The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into 
its face to see what was the matter with it.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> also its eyes were getting extremely small for 
a baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at 
all.</span>  `If you're going to turn into a pig, 
my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do 
with you.  `If it had grown up,' 
she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: 
but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.'  And she began 
thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as 
pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right 
way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing 
the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought 
Alice, and she went on.</span>  Visit either you like:  they're both mad.' <p>  `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.  You're mad.' <p>  `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  You grant 
that?' <p>  `I suppose so,' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Therefore I'm mad.' <p>  `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Do you play croquet 
with the Queen to-day?' <p>  `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been 
invited yet.' <p>  `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'd 
nearly forgotten to ask.' <p>  `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had 
come back in a natural way.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;</span>  No room!' they cried 
out when they saw Alice coming.  `There's PLENTY of room!' said 
Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one 
end of the table.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  He had been 
looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was 
his first speech.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> but all 
he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?' <p>  `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You might just 
as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat 
what I see"!' <p>  `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I 
like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!' <p>  `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to 
be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the 
same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!' <p>  `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the 
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, 
while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and 
writing-desks, which wasn't much.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What day of 
the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice:  he had taken his 
watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking 
it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</span> <p>  `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter 
grumbled:  `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.' <p>  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then 
he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he 
could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It 
was the BEST butter, you know.' <p>  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Does YOUR watch tell 
you what year it is?' <p>  `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily:  `but that's 
because it stays the same year for such a long time together.' <p>  `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> just what I was going to 
remark myself.' <p>  `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to 
Alice again.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It's HIM.' <p>  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!' <p>  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to 
beat time when I learn music.' <p>  `Ah!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Half-past one, time for dinner!' <p>  (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a 
whisper.) <p>  `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 
`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.' <p>  `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could keep 
it to half-past one as long as you liked.' <p>  `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</span>  It's always six o'clock now.' <p>  A bright idea came into Alice's head.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I vote the young lady 
tells us a story.' <p>  `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at 
the proposal.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and they lived at the bottom of a well--' <p>  `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great 
interest in questions of eating and drinking.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `VERY ill.' <p>  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways 
of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went 
on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?' <p>  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very 
earnestly.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>  `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so 
I can't take more.' <p>  `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very 
easy to take MORE than nothing.' <p>  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why did they live at the 
bottom of a well?' <p>  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and 
then said, `It was a treacle-well.' <p>  `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but 
the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh!</span> sh!' and the Dormouse 
sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the 
story for yourself.' <p>  `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly;<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And so these three little sisters--they 
were learning to draw, you know--' <p>  `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</span>  The Hatter was the 
only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a 
good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset 
the milk-jug into his plate.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `so 
I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, 
stupid?' <p>  `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not 
choosing to notice this last remark.</span> `--well in.' <p>  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse 
go on for some time without interrupting it.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `and they drew 
all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--' <p>  `Why with an M?' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up 
again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an 
M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness-- 
you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever 
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?' <p>  `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I 
don't think--' <p>  `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice thought this a very curious 
thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up 
to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice 
looked round, eager to see the Queen.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Next 
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice 
recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous 
manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without 
noticing her.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and, 
turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?' <p>  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very 
politely;</span>  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, 
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate 
gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.  `Can you play croquet?' <p>  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question 
was evidently meant for her.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  He 
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised 
himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and 
whispered `She's under sentence of execution.' <p>  `What for?' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice gave a 
little scream of laughter.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice thought she had never seen such a 
curious croquet-ground in her life;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her 
flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, 
comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, 
but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened 
out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it 
WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a 
puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: 
and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, 
it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled 
itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this, 
there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she 
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers 
were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the 
ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very 
difficult game indeed.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's no 
use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at 
least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared, 
and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the 
game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.</span> <p>  `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather 
a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't 
hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in 
particular;<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>  `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me 
to introduce it.' <p>  `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 
`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.' <p>  `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, 
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one 
of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her 
flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where 
Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up 
into a tree.</span>  I can't tell you just now what the moral of that 
is, but I shall remember it in a bit.' <p>  `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Everything's got a 
moral, if only you can find it.'  And she squeezed herself up 
closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, 
digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 
`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the 
sounds will take care of themselves."' <p>  `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to 
herself.</span>  Shall I try the 
experiment?' <p>  `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all 
anxious to have the experiment tried.  And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the 
less there is of yours."' <p>  `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this 
last remark, `it's a vegetable.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `and the moral of 
that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put 
more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than 
what it might appear to others that what you were or might have 
been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared 
to them to be otherwise."' <p>  `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very 
politely, `if I had it written down:  but I can't quite follow it 
as you say it.' <p>  `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess 
replied, in a pleased tone.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I make you 
a present of everything I've said as yet.' <p>  `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>  `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was 
beginning to feel a little worried.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice looked up, 
and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, 
frowning like a thunderstorm.</span> and Alice 
was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her 
back to the croquet-ground.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>  Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to 
Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?' <p>  `No,' said Alice.</span> and she walked off, 
leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice did not quite like 
the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would 
be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage 
Queen:  so she waited.</span>  `What fun!' 
said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> here,' thought Alice, as she went 
slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life, 
never!' <p>  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the 
distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, 
as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart 
would break.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice 
thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he 
doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was very 
nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your 
interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be 
more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</span>  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call 
him Tortoise--' <p>  `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and then they both sat silent and 
looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.</span>  `Now at OURS they had at the 
end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."' <p>  `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice;<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I only took the regular course.' <p>  `What was that?' inquired Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `and then the different branches of Arithmetic-- 
Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.' <p>  `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You know what to beautify is, 
I suppose?' <p>  `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.' <p>  `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to 
uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.' <p>  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about 
it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you 
to learn?' <p>  `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting 
off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern, 
with Seaography:  then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old 
conger-eel, that used to come once a week:  HE taught us 
Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.' <p>  `What was THAT like?' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for 
a minute or two sobs choked his voice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  At last the Mock Turtle recovered 
his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on 
again:-- <p>  `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)-- 
`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--' 
(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, 
and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful 
thing a Lobster Quadrille is!' <p>  `No, indeed,' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and the two creatures, 
who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat 
down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I've forgotten the words.' <p>  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now 
and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and 
waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle 
sang this, very slowly and sadly:-- <p> 
`"Will you walk a little faster?"</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> 
    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the 
         dance?"' <p> <p>  `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said 
Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last:  `and I do so 
like that curious song about the whiting!' <p>  `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've 
seen them, of course?' <p>  `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she 
checked herself hastily.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>  `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but 
if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're 
like.' <p>  `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.</span>  That's all.' <p>  `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting.<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Do you know why it's called a whiting?' <p>  `I never thought about it,' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I 
mean, what makes them so shiny?' <p>  Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she 
gave her answer.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Now you know.' <p>  `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great 
curiosity.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>  `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather 
impatiently:  `any shrimp could have told you that.' <p>  `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were 
still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep 
back, please:  we don't want YOU with us!"' <p>  `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle 
said:  `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.' <p>  `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR 
adventures.' <p>  `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' 
said Alice a little timidly:  `but it's no use going back to 
yesterday, because I was a different person then.' <p>  `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an 
impatient tone:  `explanations take such a dreadful time.' <p>  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when 
she first saw the White Rabbit.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Tell her to begin.'  He looked at the Gryphon as 
if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</span> `but it 
sounds uncommon nonsense.' <p>  Alice said nothing;  `How COULD 
he turn them out with his nose, you know?' <p>  `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said;<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It's by far 
the most confusing thing I ever heard!' <p>  `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon:  and 
Alice was only too glad to do so.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you 
a song?' <p>  `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' 
Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather 
offended tone, `Hm!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large 
dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice 
quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,' 
she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!'  But there seemed 
to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about 
her, to pass away the time.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>  `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve 
creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because 
some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they 
are the jurors.'  She said this last word two or three times over 
to herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and 
rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the 
meaning of it at all.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `They 
can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.' <p>  `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in 
reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the 
trial.' <p>  `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but 
she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in 
the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked 
anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `A nice muddle their slates'll be in 
before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This of course, 
Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got 
behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it 
away.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I can hardly breathe.' <p>  `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing.' <p>  `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  They had 
a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: 
into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat 
upon it.) <p>  `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She carried the 
pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before 
she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began 
sneezing all at once.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> 
Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top 
of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!' <p> <p>                           CHAPTER XII <p>                        Alice's Evidence <p> 
  `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the 
moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she 
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with 
the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads 
of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding 
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset 
the week before.</span>  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE 
HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.' <p>  Everybody looked at Alice. `so now let the jury--' <p>  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had 
grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit 
afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. `Why, what a long 
sleep you've had!' <p>  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told 
her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange 
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about;<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> it's 
getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she 
ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <p>  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her 
head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of 
little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began 
dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- <p>  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the 
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes 
were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her 
voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back 
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and 
still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place 
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little 
sister's dream.</span>
