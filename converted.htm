                            CHAPTER I 
 
                      Down the Rabbit-Hole 
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister 
</span>
on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,' 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?' 
</span>
 
  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</span>
 
  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to 
</span>
itself, `Oh dear!
  Oh dear!
it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT- 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop 
</span>
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once 
</span>
considering how in the world she was to get out again.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself 
</span>
falling down a very deep well.
 
  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she 
had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to 
wonder what was going to happen next.
down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to 
 then she looked at the sides of the well, and 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing 
</span>
somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she 
fell past it.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I 
</span>
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!
all think me at home!
even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely 
true.) 
 
  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for, 
</span>
you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her 
lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good 
opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to 
listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes, 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to 
</span>
say.) 
 
  `I wonder if I shall fall right 
  How funny it'll seem to come out among the 
people that walk with their heads downward!
think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling 
</span>
  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.' 
</span>
 
  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon 
  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>should think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember 
</span>
her saucer of milk at tea-time.
  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>way, `Do cats eat bats?</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either 
</span>
question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>bat?' when suddenly, thump!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in 
</span>
sight, hurrying down it.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps 
</span>
hanging from the roof.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;</span>
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, 
</span>
wondering how she was ever to get out again.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of 
</span>
 there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, 
and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the 
doors of the hall;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of 
</span>
  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but 
</span>
she could not even get her head though the doorway;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of 
</span>
very little use without my shoulders.
I could shut up like a telescope!
know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few 
</span>
things indeed were really impossible.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME' 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>beautifully printed on it in large letters.</span>
 
  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little 
Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>for she had read several nice little histories about children who 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant 
</span>
things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker 
</span>
will burn you if you hold it too long;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or 
</span>
later.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished 
</span>
it off.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>         *       *       *       *       *       * 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * 
</span>
 
  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice;
like a telescope.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.</span>
First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about 
</span>
 `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my 
going out altogether, like a candle.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember 
</span>
ever having seen such a thing.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided 
</span>
 but, alas for poor Alice!
when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, 
</span>
she found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb 
</span>
up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the poor little thing sat down and cried.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to 
</span>
 `I advise you to leave off this minute!' 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so 
</span>
severely as to bring tears into her eyes;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious 
</span>
child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!</span>
there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable 
person!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger, 
</span>
 and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep 
 so either way I'll get into the garden, and I 
don't care which happens!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which 
</span>
  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the 
</span>
common way.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>         *       *       *       *       *       * 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * 
</span>
 
 
 
 
                           CHAPTER II 
 
                        The Pool of Tears 
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good 
</span>
 `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that 
  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so 
</span>
  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on 
your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself 
about you:  you must manage the best way you can;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the 
</span>
  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of 
boots every Christmas.' 
 
  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.
`They must go by the carrier,' she thought;
seem, sending presents to one's own feet!
directions will look!
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>            ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</span>
                HEARTHRUG, 
                    NEAR THE FENDER, 
                        (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).
 
Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</span>
 
  Poor Alice!
  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>side, to look through into the garden with one eye;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>through was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to 
</span>
cry again.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great 
</span>
girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in 
  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the 
</span>
hall.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to 
</span>
 the Duchess, the Duchess!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate 
</span>
that she was ready to ask help of any one;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard 
</span>
as he could go.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 
</span>
`Dear, dear!
  How queer everything is to-day!
  I wonder if I've been changed in 
the night?
  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this 
  I almost think I can remember feeling a little 
  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in 
  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age 
</span>
as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of 
them.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, 
</span>
 she knows such a very little!
and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!
  Let me see:  four times five is twelve, 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!</span>
I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Multiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, 
</span>
and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!
  I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:-- 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>            `How doth the little crocodile 
</span>
              Improve his shining tail, 
            And pour the waters of the Nile 
              On every golden scale!
 
            `How cheerfully he seems to grin, 
              How neatly spread his claws, 
            And welcome little fishes in 
              With gently smiling jaws!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little 
</span>
house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh!
many lessons to learn!
  No, I've made up my mind about it;
Mabel, I'll stay down here!
heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!"
  Tell me that first, and then, if I 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads 
</span>
  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!' 
 
  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little 
</span>
white kid gloves while she was talking.
  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in 
</span>
 `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>back to the little door:  but, alas!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`for I never was so small as this before, never!</span>
it's too bad, that it is!' 
 
  As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another 
 she was up to her chin in salt water.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that 
</span>
case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine 
</span>
feet high.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, 
</span>
trying to find her way out.
suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!
  However, everything is queer to-day.' 
 
  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at 
</span>
first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then 
she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that 
it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this 
</span>
  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>think very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>trying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of 
</span>
  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!' 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: 
</span>
she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>mouse--a mouse--O mouse!')  The Mouse looked at her rather 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little 
</span>
eyes, but it said nothing.
 
  `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Conqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>began again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in 
</span>
  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the 
water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the 
</span>
poor animal's feelings.
  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate 
</span>
  `Would YOU like cats if you were me?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone:  `don't be 
</span>
  And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt 
</span>
  `We won't talk about her any 
more if you'd rather not.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end 
</span>
  `As if I would talk on such a subject!
always HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!
the name again!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the 
</span>
  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly 
</span>
  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and 
</span>
making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
 
  So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded 
</span>
with the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious 
</span>
  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the 
shore.
 
 
 
                           CHAPTER III 
 
                  A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale 
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and 
</span>
uncomfortable.
 
  The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with 
</span>
them, as if she had known them all her life.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no 
</span>
more to be said.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among 
</span>
them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>soon make you dry enough!'  They all sat down at once, in a large 
</span>
ring, with the Mouse in the middle.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad 
</span>
cold if she did not get dry very soon.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?</span>
This is the driest thing I know.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been 
</span>
of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"' 
</span>
 
  `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very 
</span>
politely:  `Did you speak?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.</span>
 
  `I thought you did,' said the Mouse.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found 
</span>
it advisable--"' 
 
  `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course you 
</span>
know what "it" means.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said 
</span>
the Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm.
what did the archbishop find?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William 
</span>
and offer him the crown.
  But the insolence of his Normans--"  How are you 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it 
</span>
spoke.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn't 
</span>
seem to dry me at all.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more 
</span>
energetic remedies--' 
 
  `Speak English!' said the Eaglet.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>either!'  And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: 
</span>
some of the other birds tittered audibly.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.' 
</span>
 
  `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.' 
</span>
(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.) 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party 
</span>
were placed along the course, here and there.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know 
</span>
  However, when they had been running half 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting, 
</span>
and asking, `But who has won?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.</span>
last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have 
prizes.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices 
</span>
asked.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with 
</span>
 and the whole party at once crowded round her, 
calling out in a confused way, `Prizes!
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</span>
There was exactly one a-piece all round.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.</span>
 
  `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.
you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.</span>
 
  `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.
 
  Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of 
</span>
this elegant thimble';
 and, when it had finished this short 
speech, they all cheered.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked 
</span>
so grave that she did not dare to laugh;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, 
</span>
looking as solemn as she could.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on 
</span>
the back.
  However, it was over at last, and they sat down again 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half 
</span>
afraid that it would be offended again.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to 
</span>
Alice, and sighing.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with 
</span>
wonder at the Mouse's tail;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so 
</span>
that her idea of the tale was something like this:-- 
 
                    `Fury said to a 
                   mouse, That he 
                 met in the 
               house, 
            "Let us 
              both go to 
                law:  I will 
                  prosecute 
                    YOU.
  --Come, 
                       I'll take no 
                        denial;
                     must have a 
                 trial:  For 
              really this 
           morning I've 
          nothing 
         to do."
           Said the 
             mouse to the 
               cur, "Such 
                 a trial, 
                   dear Sir, 
                         With 
                     no jury 
                  or judge, 
                would be 
              wasting 
             our 
              breath."
               "I'll be 
                 judge, I'll 
                   be jury," 
                         Said 
                    cunning 
                      old Fury: 
                     "I'll 
                      try the 
                         whole 
                          cause, 
                             and 
                        condemn 
                       you 
                      to 
                       death."' 
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.</span>
`What are you thinking of?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly:  `you had got to 
</span>
the fifth bend, I think?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and 
</span>
  `Oh, do let me help to undo it!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up 
</span>
  `You insult me by talking such nonsense!' 
 
  `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice.
offended, you know!' 
 
  The Mouse only growled in reply.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after 
</span>
 and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little 
</span>
quicker.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it 
</span>
 and an old Crab took the opportunity of 
saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>never to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the 
</span>
young Crab, a little snappishly.
patience of an oyster!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, 
</span>
  `She'd soon fetch it back!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' 
</span>
said the Lory.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about 
</span>
her pet:  `Dinah's our cat.
catching mice you can't think!
after the birds!
  Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look 
at it!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one old Magpie began 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be 
</span>
 the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my 
</span>
  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a 
</span>
melancholy tone.
  `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm 
sure she's the best cat in the world!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to 
</span>
finish his story.
 
 
 
                           CHAPTER IV 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>                The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill 
</span>
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and 
</span>
looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!</span>
Oh my dear paws!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>dropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed in a moment that it was 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she 
</span>
very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were 
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the little door, had vanished completely.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE 
</span>
  Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of 
  Quick, now!'  And Alice was so much frightened 
that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without 
trying to explain the mistake it had made.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door 
</span>
of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W.
  She went in without knocking, and hurried 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and 
</span>
gloves.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going 
</span>
  I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>messages next!'  And she began fancying the sort of thing that 
</span>
  Come here directly, and get ready 
 "Coming in a minute, nurse!
  Only I don't think,' Alice went 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering 
</span>
people about like that!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking- 
</span>
  There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,' 
but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself, 
</span>
`whenever I eat or drink anything;
  I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!' 
</span>
 
  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being 
</span>
  She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so 
</span>
much!' 
 
  Alas!
 it was too late to wish that!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in 
</span>
another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the 
</span>
other arm curled round her head.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more, 
</span>
whatever happens.
  What WILL become of me?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>effect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about 
</span>
by mice and rabbits.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know, 
</span>
this sort of life!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a 
</span>
 `at least there's no room to grow up any more 
HERE.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I 
</span>
  That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman-- 
but then--always to have lessons to learn!
 
  `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself.
learn lessons in here?
room at all for any lesson-books!' 
 
  And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, 
and making quite a conversation of it altogether;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</span>
 
  Mary Ann!' said the voice.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>this moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on the 
</span>
  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no 
</span>
reason to be afraid of it.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed 
</span>
hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was 
</span>
just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something 
of the sort.
 
  Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>you?'  And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then 
</span>
  Digging for apples, yer honour!' 
 
  `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Come and help me out of THIS!'  (Sounds of more broken glass.) 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'  (He pronounced it `arrum.') 
</span>
 
  `An arm, you goose!
fills the whole window!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's an arm for all that.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate:  go and take it 
</span>
away!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear 
</span>
 such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>honour, at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at 
</span>
last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in 
  This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more 
sounds of broken glass.
must be!' thought Alice.
pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!
don't want to stay in here any longer!' 
 
  She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  at 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>good many voices all talking together:  she made out the words: 
</span>
`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;
 fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half 
</span>
high enough yet--Oh!
 don't be particular-- 
 catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind 
that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go 
</span>
down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't!
then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill!
go down the chimney!' 
 
 So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said 
  `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal:  this fireplace is 
</span>
 but I THINK I can kick a little!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>above her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?</span>
  Tell us all about it!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,' 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know 
</span>
is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes 
like a sky-rocket!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice;</span>
Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do.
Dinah at you!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to 
</span>
herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A 
</span>
barrowful will do, to begin with.' 
 
  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead 
</span>
silence.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright 
</span>
idea came into her head.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I 
</span>
suppose.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find 
</span>
that she began shrinking directly.
enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by 
</span>
two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a 
</span>
thick wood.
 
  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.</span>
I think that will be the best plan.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and 
</span>
simply arranged;
 the only difficulty was, that she had not the 
smallest idea how to set about it;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her head made her look up in a great hurry.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried 
</span>
hard to whistle to it;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>stick, and held it out to the puppy;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, 
</span>
and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run 
</span>
 and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in 
</span>
its hurry to get hold of it;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle 
</span>
 then the puppy began a series of short charges at the 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the 
</span>
distance.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks 
</span>
very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!
  I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!
  I suppose I ought to eat or 
 but the great question is, what?' 
 
  The great question certainly was, what?
her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under 
</span>
  There was a large mushroom growing near her, 
about the same height as herself;
it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her 
that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice 
</span>
of her or of anything else.
 
 
 
                            CHAPTER V 
 
                    Advice from a Caterpillar 
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>silence:  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</span>
 
  `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.
 
  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present-- 
</span>
at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think 
I must have been changed several times since then.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</span>
`Explain yourself!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because 
</span>
I'm not myself, you see.' 
 
  `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with;</span>
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.' 
 
  `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.
 
  `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice;
when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>feel it a little queer, won't you?' 
</span>
 
  `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.
 
  `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.' 
</span>
 
  `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.
 
  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the 
  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.' 
</span>
 
  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.
 
  Here was another puzzling question;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</span>
 
  `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.
important to say!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back 
</span>
again.
 
  `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as 
</span>
she could.
 
  `No,' said the Caterpillar.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else 
</span>
to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth 
  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice folded her hands, and began:-- 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `You are old, Father William,' the young man said, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>      `And your hair has become very white;</span>
    And yet you incessantly stand on your head-- 
      Do you think, at your age, it is right?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>      `I feared it might injure the brain;</span>
    But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none, 
      Why, I do it again and again.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before, 
</span>
      And have grown most uncommonly fat;
    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door-- 
      Pray, what is the reason of that?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>      `I kept all my limbs very supple 
</span>
    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box-- 
      Allow me to sell you a couple?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak 
</span>
      For anything tougher than suet;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak-- 
</span>
      Pray how did you manage to do it?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law, 
</span>
      And argued each case with my wife;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, 
</span>
      Has lasted the rest of my life.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose 
</span>
      That your eye was as steady as ever;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose-- 
</span>
      What made you so awfully clever?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,' 
</span>
 `don't give yourself airs!
    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
      Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!' 
 
 
  `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.
 
  `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly;
words have got altered.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar 
</span>
decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.
 
  The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What size do you want to be?' it asked.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;</span>
`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.' 
 
  `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
 
  Alice said nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched 
</span>
height to be.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three 
</span>
inches high).
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so 
</span>
easily offended!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and 
</span>
the other side will make you grow shorter.' 
 
  `One side of WHAT?
herself.
 
  `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had 
asked it aloud;
 and in another moment it was out of sight.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a 
</span>
minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her 
</span>
foot!
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking 
</span>
 so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hardly room to open her mouth;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</span>
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>         *       *       *       *       *       * 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay 
</span>
far below her.
 
  `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice.
  And oh, my poor hands, how is it I 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>can't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the 
</span>
distant green leaves.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, 
</span>
  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which 
</span>
she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating 
</span>
her violently with its wings.
 
  `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.
 
  `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every 
</span>
way, and nothing seems to suit them!' 
 
  `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said 
Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've 
</span>
tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her;
  There's no pleasing them!' 
 
  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the 
</span>
 `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and 
  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was 
</span>
beginning to see its meaning.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come 
</span>
wriggling down from the sky!
 
  `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice.
a--' 
 
  `Well!
  WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.
trying to invent something!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the 
</span>
  `I've seen a good many little girls in my 
time, but never ONE with such a neck as that!
  I suppose you'll be 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>telling me next that you never tasted an egg!' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very 
</span>
 `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as 
serpents do, you know.' 
 
  `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon;
then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a 
</span>
serpent?' 
 
  `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily;
not looking for eggs, as it happens;
want YOURS:  I don't like them raw.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it 
</span>
settled down again into its nest.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled 
</span>
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and 
  After a while she remembered that she still held the 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very 
</span>
carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</span>
 
  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, 
that it felt quite strange at first;
few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.
there's half my plan done now!
  I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to 
  However, I've got back to my right size:  the next 
thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be 
done, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come 
</span>
upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wits!'  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself 
</span>
down to nine inches high.
 
 
 
                           CHAPTER VI 
 
                         Pig and Pepper 
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>because he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face only, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door 
</span>
  It was opened by another footman in livery, 
with a round face, and large eyes like a frog;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their 
</span>
  She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>invitation from the Queen to play croquet.'  The Frog-Footman 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the 
</span>
words a little, `From the Queen.
to play croquet.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled 
</span>
together.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into 
</span>
the wood for fear of their hearing her;
out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and 
</span>
that for two reasons.
 secondly, because they're making such a noise 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>inside, no one could possibly hear you.'  And certainly there was 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish 
</span>
or kettle had been broken to pieces.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went 
</span>
on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.
instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time 
</span>
he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.
perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself;
VERY nearly at the top of his head.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees 
</span>
behind him.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, 
</span>
exactly as if nothing had happened.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</span>
 
  `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman.
first question, you know.' 
 
  It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the 
</span>
creatures argue.
  It's enough to drive one crazy!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for 
</span>
repeating his remark, with variations.
said, `on and off, for days and days.' 
 
  `But what am I to do?' said Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>smoke from one end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a 
</span>
three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to 
</span>
be full of soup.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to 
</span>
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
 
  There was certainly too much of it in the air.
Duchess sneezed occasionally;
 and as for the baby, it was 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.</span>
only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ear to ear.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for 
</span>
she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>speak first, `why your cat grins like that?' 
</span>
 
  `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice 
</span>
 but she saw in another moment that it was addressed 
to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on 
again:-- 
 
  `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned;
didn't know that cats COULD grin.' 
 
 `and most of 'em do.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, 
</span>
feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.
 
  `You don't know much,' said the Duchess;
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought 
</span>
it would be as well to introduce some other subject of 
  While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby 
</span>
--the fire-irons came first;
  The Duchess took no notice of them even when 
 and the baby was howling so much already, that it 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up 
</span>
and down in an agony of terror.
 as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very 
nearly carried it off.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it 
</span>
does.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her 
</span>
  `Just think of what work it would make with the day 
  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn 
round on its axis--' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant 
</span>
 but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and 
seemed not to be listening, so she went on again:  `Twenty-four 
hours, I THINK;
 
  `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>figures!'  And with that she began nursing her child again, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>violent shake at the end of every line: 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>        `Speak roughly to your little boy, 
</span>
          And beat him when he sneezes: 
        He only does it to annoy, 
          Because he knows it teases.' 
 
                    CHORUS.
 
    (In which the cook and the baby joined):-- 
 
                `Wow!
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:-- 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>        `I speak severely to my boy, 
</span>
          I beat him when he sneezes;
        For he can thoroughly enjoy 
          The pepper when he pleases!' 
 
                    CHORUS.
 
                `Wow!
 
 you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said 
to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of 
</span>
  The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, 
but it just missed her.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer- 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all 
</span>
directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, 
</span>
and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, 
so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much 
as she could do to hold it.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its 
</span>
undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave it 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>behind?'  She said the last words out loud, and the little thing 
</span>
grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
 `that's not at all a proper way of expressing 
yourself.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into 
</span>
its face to see what was the matter with it.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout 
</span>
 also its eyes were getting extremely small for 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at 
</span>
  `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked 
into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.
 
  `If you're going to turn into a pig, 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do 
</span>
  Mind now!'  The poor little thing sobbed again (or 
grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for 
some while in silence.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I 
</span>
to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted 
again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some 
  This time there could be NO mistake about it:  it was 
neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be 
quite absurd for her to carry it further.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to 
</span>
see it trot away quietly into the wood.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.'  And she began 
</span>
thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</span>
 
  The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>natured, she thought:  still it had VERY long claws and a great 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at 
</span>
all know whether it would like the name:  however, it only 
  `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought 
  `Would you tell me, please, which way I 
ought to go from here?' 
 
  `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said 
the Cat.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I don't much care where--' said Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk 
</span>
long enough.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another 
</span>
  `What sort of people live about here?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`lives a Hatter:  and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 
</span>
`lives a March Hare.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat:  `we're all mad here.</span>
I'm mad.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.' 
</span>
 
  Alice didn't think that proved it at all;
`And how do you know that you're mad?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad.</span>
that?' 
 
  `I suppose so,' said Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's 
</span>
angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.
pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</span>
 
  `Do you play croquet 
with the Queen to-day?' 
 
  `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been 
invited yet.' 
 
  `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used 
</span>
to queer things happening.
where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.
 
  `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat.
nearly forgotten to ask.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>come back in a natural way.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the 
</span>
direction in which the March Hare was said to live.
 `the March Hare will be 
much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.'  As she said 
</span>
this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a 
branch of a tree.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.</span>
 
  `I said pig,' replied Alice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>appearing and vanishing so suddenly:  you make one quite giddy.' 
</span>
 
  `All right,' said the Cat;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</span>
 
  I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;
`but a grin without a cat!
saw in my life!' 
 
  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>house of the March Hare:  she thought it must be the right house, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was 
</span>
thatched with fur.
  It was so large a house, that she did not 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high:  even 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself 
</span>
`Suppose it should be raving mad after all!
gone to see the Hatter instead!' 
 
 
 
                           CHAPTER VII 
 
                         A Mad Tea-Party 
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it:  a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking 
</span>
  `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded 
</span>
together at one corner of it:  `No room!
out when they saw Alice coming.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one 
</span>
end of the table.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it 
</span>
  `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.
 
  `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice 
</span>
angrily.
 
  `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being 
invited,' said the March Hare.
 
  `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice;
great many more than three.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was 
</span>
his first speech.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said 
</span>
 `it's very rude.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this;</span>
he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?' 
 
  `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she 
</span>
added aloud.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' 
</span>
said the March Hare.
 
  `Exactly so,' said Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.</span>
 
  `I do,' Alice hastily replied;
I say--that's the same thing, you know.' 
 
  `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat 
</span>
what I see"!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I 
</span>
like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the 
</span>
same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!' 
 
  `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and 
</span>
writing-desks, which wasn't much.
 
  The Hatter was the first to break the silence.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice:  he had taken his 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking 
</span>
it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.' 
</span>
 
  `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March 
</span>
Hare.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.</span>
 
  `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>grumbled:  `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It 
</span>
was the BEST butter, you know.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</span>
`What a funny watch!' she remarked.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!' 
</span>
 
  `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter.
you what year it is?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily:  `but that's 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>because it stays the same year for such a long time together.' 
</span>
 
  `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.
 
  Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.</span>
`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she 
could.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a little hot tea upon its nose.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>opening its eyes, `Of course, of course;</span>
remark myself.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to 
</span>
Alice again.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `what's the answer?' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.</span>
 
  `Nor I,' said the March Hare.
 
  Alice sighed wearily.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that 
</span>
have no answers.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you 
</span>
wouldn't talk about wasting IT.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head 
</span>
  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>beat time when I learn music.' 
</span>
 
  `He won't stand 
  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do 
almost anything you liked with the clock.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the 
</span>
  Half-past one, time for dinner!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a 
</span>
whisper.) 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could keep 
</span>
it to half-past one as long as you liked.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</span>
 
  The Hatter shook his head mournfully.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>            "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</span>
            How I wonder what you're at!"
 
You know the song, perhaps?' 
 
  `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:-- 
</span>
 
            "Up above the world you fly, 
            Like a tea-tray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle--"' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that 
</span>
they had to pinch it to make it stop.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the 
</span>
time!
  Off with his head!"' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 
</span>
`he won't do a thing I ask!
 
  A bright idea came into Alice's head.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice 
</span>
ventured to ask.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, 
</span>
  I vote the young lady 
tells us a story.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at 
</span>
the proposal.
 
  `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.
Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.
 
  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>said in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word you fellows 
</span>
were saying.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep 
</span>
again before it's done.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the 
</span>
Dormouse began in a great hurry;
 and they lived at the bottom of a well--' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>interest in questions of eating and drinking.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a 
</span>
minute or two.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently 
</span>
 `they'd have been ill.' 
 
  `So they were,' said the Dormouse;
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways 
</span>
of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very 
</span>
earnestly.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so 
</span>
I can't take more.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very 
</span>
easy to take MORE than nothing.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked 
</span>
triumphantly.
 
  Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the 
</span>
Dormouse, and repeated her question.
bottom of a well?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and 
</span>
then said, `It was a treacle-well.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but 
</span>
the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the 
</span>
story for yourself.' 
 
  `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly;
  I dare say there may be ONE.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.</span>
  `And so these three little sisters--they 
were learning to draw, you know--' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</span>
 
  `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this 
time.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's all move 
</span>
one place on.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather 
</span>
unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.
only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset 
</span>
the milk-jug into his plate.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began 
</span>
very cautiously:  `But I don't understand.
the treacle from?' 
 
  `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, 
</span>
stupid?' 
 
  `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not 
choosing to notice this last remark.
 
  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse;
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse 
</span>
go on for some time without interrupting it.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and 
</span>
rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--' 
</span>
 
  `Why with an M?' said Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why not?' said the March Hare.</span>
 
  Alice was silent.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going 
</span>
 but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness-- 
</span>
you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever 
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I 
</span>
don't think--' 
 
  `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got 
</span>
up in great disgust, and walked off;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she 
</span>
picked her way through the wood.
ever was at in all my life!' 
 
  Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a 
door leading right into it.
`But everything's curious today.
  I think I may as well go in at once.' 
And in she went.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the 
</span>
  `Now, I'll manage better this time,' 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and unlocking the door that led into the garden.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the little passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</span>
 
 
 
                          CHAPTER VIII 
 
                   The Queen's Croquet-Ground 
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at 
</span>
it, busily painting them red.
thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up 
to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!
splashing paint over me like that!' 
 
  `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone;
my elbow.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!</span>
lay the blame on others!' 
 
  `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!' 
 
  `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are 
</span>
painting those roses?' 
 
  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;</span>
and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads 
  So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who had been anxiously 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looking across the garden, called out `The Queen!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon 
</span>
  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looked round, eager to see the Queen.</span>
 
  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers;</span>
ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the 
  After these came the royal children;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous 
</span>
manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without 
  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember 
</span>
ever having heard of such a rule at processions;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people 
</span>
had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?' 
So she stood still where she was, and waited.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?' 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very 
</span>
 but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of 
cards, after all.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>gardeners who were lying round the rosetree;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her 
</span>
own children.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.</span>
`It's no business of MINE.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!</span>
Off--' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the 
</span>
Queen was silent.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 
</span>
`Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 
</span>
`Turn them over!' 
 
  The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</span>
 
  `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.
And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you 
been doing here?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the 
</span>
  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a 
</span>
large flower-pot that stood near.
about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly 
marched off after the others.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers 
</span>
shouted in reply.
 
  `That's right!' shouted the Queen.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question 
</span>
was evidently meant for her.
 
  `Yes!' shouted Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the 
</span>
procession, wondering very much what would happen next.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously 
</span>
into her face.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?' 
</span>
 
  Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>whispered `She's under sentence of execution.' 
</span>
 
  `What for?' said Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.</span>
I said "What for?"' 
 
  `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.
  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a 
  `The Queen will hear you!
rather late, and the Queen said--' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up 
</span>
 however, they got settled down in a minute or 
  Alice thought she had never seen such a 
curious croquet-ground in her life;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: 
</span>
and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers 
</span>
were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very 
</span>
difficult game indeed.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The players all played at once without waiting for turns, 
</span>
quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with 
</span>
her head!' about once in a minute.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as 
</span>
yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of 
</span>
  They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here;
wonder is, that there's any one left alive!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at 
</span>
first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I 
</span>
shall have somebody to talk to.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was 
</span>
mouth enough for it to speak with.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and 
</span>
no more of it appeared.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in 
</span>
 at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and 
you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;
for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next 
walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it 
</span>
saw mine coming!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while 
</span>
finishing the game.' 
 
  The Queen smiled and passed on.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me 
</span>
to introduce it.' 
 
  `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.' 
</span>
 
  `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.</span>
 
  `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.
some book, but I don't remember where.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!</span>
wish you would have this cat removed!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great 
</span>
  `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking 
round.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and 
</span>
he hurried off.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, 
</span>
  She had already heard her sentence three 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and 
</span>
she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or 
</span>
  So she went in search of her hedgehog.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one 
</span>
of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up 
</span>
into a tree.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, 
</span>
the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>are gone from this side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away 
</span>
under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for 
a little more conversation with her friend.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who 
</span>
were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, 
and looked very uncomfortable.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed 
</span>
to make out exactly what they said.
 
  The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a 
head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had 
never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin 
at HIS time of life.
 
  The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be 
beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.
 
  The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about 
it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so 
</span>
grave and anxious.) 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Duchess:  you'd better ask HER about it.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner:  `fetch 
</span>
her here.'  And the executioner went off like an arrow.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>   The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely 
</span>
 so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</span>
 
 
 
                           CHAPTER IX 
 
                     The Mock Turtle's Story 
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately 
</span>
into Alice's, and they walked off together.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and 
</span>
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had 
made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.
 
  `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT 
</span>
  Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar 
</span>
and such things that make children sweet-tempered.
people knew that:  then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you 
know--' 
 
  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you 
</span>
  I can't tell you just now what the moral of that 
is, but I shall remember it in a bit.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.</span>
 
  `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>moral, if only you can find it.'  And she squeezed herself up 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</span>
 
  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first, 
because the Duchess was VERY ugly;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, 
</span>
and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.
like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of 
</span>
keeping up the conversation a little.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `'Tis so,' said the Duchess:  `and the moral of that is--"Oh, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody 
</span>
minding their own business!' 
 
  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sounds will take care of themselves."' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to 
</span>
herself.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>waist,' the Duchess said after a pause:  `the reason is, that I'm 
</span>
doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.
experiment?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all 
</span>
anxious to have the experiment tried.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Very true,' said the Duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard both 
</span>
  And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock 
together."' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess:  `what a clear way you 
</span>
have of putting things!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree 
</span>
 `there's a large mustard-mine near 
  And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the 
less there is of yours."' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this 
</span>
last remark, `it's a vegetable.
is.' 
 
  `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than 
</span>
what it might appear to others that what you were or might have 
been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared 
to them to be otherwise."' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>politely, `if I had it written down:  but I can't quite follow it 
</span>
as you say it.' 
 
  `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess 
replied, in a pleased tone.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' 
</span>
said Alice.
 
  `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess.
a present of everything I've said as yet.' 
 
  `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>give birthday presents like that!'  But she did not venture to 
</span>
say it out loud.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her 
</span>
sharp little chin.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>beginning to feel a little worried.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;</span>
and the m--' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the 
</span>
arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, 
</span>
frowning like a thunderstorm.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak 
</span>
voice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on 
</span>
the ground as she spoke;
and that in about half no time!
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her 
</span>
back to the croquet-ground.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>moment's delay would cost them their lives.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  All the time they were playing the Queen never left off 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>head!' or `Off with her head!'  Those whom she sentenced were 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour 
</span>
or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of 
</span>
execution.
 
  Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?' 
</span>
 
  `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his 
</span>
history,' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.'  `Come, 
</span>
THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the 
</span>
  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to 
</span>
see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.
see after some executions I have ordered';
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage 
</span>
Queen:  so she waited.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the 
</span>
Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</span>
 
  `What IS the fun?' said Alice.
 
  `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.
never executes nobody, you know.
 
  `Everybody says "come on!"
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life, 
</span>
never!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart 
</span>
  `What is his sorrow?' she 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the 
</span>
same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got 
no sorrow, you know.
 
  So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to 
</span>
know your history, she do.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've 
</span>
finished.' 
 
  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he 
</span>
doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was 
</span>
a real Turtle.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and 
</span>
the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be 
</span>
more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to 
</span>
  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call 
him Tortoise--' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Turtle angrily:  `really you are very dull!' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple 
</span>
question,' added the Gryphon;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!</span>
Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words: 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe 
</span>
it--' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.</span>
 
  `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak 
</span>
  The Mock Turtle went on.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school 
</span>
every day--' 
 
  `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice;
so proud as all that.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.</span>
 
 then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock 
Turtle in a tone of great relief.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."' 
</span>
 
  `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice;
bottom of the sea.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a 
</span>
  `I only took the regular course.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What was that?' inquired Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock 
</span>
 `and then the different branches of Arithmetic-- 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.' 
</span>
 
  `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say.
 
  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.
heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed.
I suppose?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to 
</span>
uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you 
</span>
to learn?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>with Seaography:  then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>conger-eel, that used to come once a week:  HE taught us 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.' 
</span>
 
  `What was THAT like?' said Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said:  `I'm 
</span>
  And the Gryphon never learnt it.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon:  `I went to the Classics 
</span>
  He was an old crab, HE was.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh:  `he 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a 
</span>
hurry to change the subject.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the 
</span>
next, and so on.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>remarked:  `because they lessen from day to day.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a 
</span>
  `Then the eleventh day 
must have been a holiday?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>very decided tone:  `tell her something about the games now.' 
</span>
 
 
 
                            CHAPTER X 
 
                      The Lobster Quadrille 
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper 
</span>
  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for 
a minute or two sobs choked his voice.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in his throat,' said the Gryphon:  and it set to work shaking him 
</span>
  At last the Mock Turtle recovered 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on 
</span>
again:-- 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)-- 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--' 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful 
</span>
thing a Lobster Quadrille is!' 
 
  `What sort of a dance is it?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle.</span>
then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.</span>
 
  `--you advance twice--' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said:  `advance twice, set to 
</span>
partners--' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the 
</span>
Gryphon.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `--as far out to sea as you can--' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, 
</span>
capering wildly about.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</span>
 
  `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the 
Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.</span>
 
  `Very much indeed,' said Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the

  `We can do without lobsters, you know.

  `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle 
</span>
sang this, very slowly and sadly:-- 
 
 
`"Will you walk a little faster?"
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my 
</span>
 tail.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the 
</span>
dance?
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the 
</span>
dance?
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the 
</span>
dance?
 
 
"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be 
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to 
                                                      sea!"
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>But the snail replied "Too far, too far!"</span>
                                                       askance-- 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the 
</span>
   dance.
    Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join 
        the dance.
    Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join 
        the dance.
 
`"What matters it how far we go?"
"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>The further off from England the nearer is to France-- 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the

         dance?
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the

         dance?"' 
 
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last:  `and I do so 
</span>
like that curious song about the whiting!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've 
</span>
seen them, of course?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she 
</span>
checked herself hastily.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but

if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're 
like.' 
 
  `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.

<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 
</span>
`crumbs would all wash off in the sea.
 and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all 
</span>
that,' he said to the Gryphon.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with

the lobsters to the dance.

  That's all.' 
 
  `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting.
so much about a whiting before.' 
 
  `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the 
  `Do you know why it's called a whiting?' 
 
  `I never thought about it,' said Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very 
</span>
solemnly.
 
  Alice was thoroughly puzzled.
repeated in a wondering tone.
 
  `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon.
mean, what makes them so shiny?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she 
</span>
  `They're done with blacking, I believe.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep 
</span>
voice, `are done with a whiting.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great 
</span>
curiosity.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>impatiently:  `any shrimp could have told you that.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep 
</span>
back, please:  we don't want YOU with us!"' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>said:  `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle:  `why, if a fish came 
</span>
to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With 
what porpoise?"' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended 
</span>
  And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR 
adventures.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>said Alice a little timidly:  `but it's no use going back to 
</span>
yesterday, because I was a different person then.' 
 
  `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.
 
  The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>impatient tone:  `explanations take such a dreadful time.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when 
</span>
she first saw the White Rabbit.
it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she 
</span>
gained courage as she went on.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said 
</span>
`That's very curious.' 
 
  `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated 
</span>
  `I should like to hear her try and repeat 
  Tell her to begin.'  He looked at the Gryphon as 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said 
</span>
the Gryphon.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat 
</span>
lessons!' thought Alice;
 `I might as well be at school at once.' 
However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>saying, and the words came very queer indeed:-- 
</span>
 
    `'Tis the voice of the Lobster;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."</span>
    As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>              [later editions continued as follows 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,

<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.] 
</span>
 
  `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' 
said the Gryphon.
 
  `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle;
sounds uncommon nonsense.' 
 
 she had sat down with her face in her 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way 
</span>
again.

  `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily.

  `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted.
he turn them out with his nose, you know?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the 
</span>
subject.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`it begins "I passed by his garden."' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:-- 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>        [later editions continued as follows 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl, 
</span>
    And concluded the banquet--] 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle 
</span>
interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on?
the most confusing thing I ever heard!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon:  and 
</span>
Alice was only too glad to do so.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the 
</span>
  `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you 
a song?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather 
</span>
offended tone, `Hm!
  No accounting for tastes!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>choked with sobs, to sing this:-- 
</span>
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green, 
</span>
    Waiting in a hot tureen!
    Who for such dainties would not stoop?
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</span>
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>        Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</span>
 
    `Beautiful Soup!
    Game, or any other dish?
    Who would not give all else for two 
    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, 
        Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!' 
</span>
was heard in the distance.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the 
</span>
melancholy words:-- 
 
    `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>        Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'

                           CHAPTER XI 
 
                      Who Stole the Tarts?
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on 
</span>
 and near the King was the White Rabbit, 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the 
</span>
  In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,' 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!'  But there seemed 
</span>
to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about 
her, to pass away the time.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that 
</span>
she knew the name of nearly everything there.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.' 
</span>
 
  The judge, by the way, was the King;
over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly 
</span>
not becoming.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve 
</span>
creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>are the jurors.'  She said this last word two or three times over 
</span>
to herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the 
</span>
meaning of it at all.
as well.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.</span>
`What are they doing?'  Alice whispered to the Gryphon.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the 
</span>
trial.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked 
</span>
anxiously round, to make out who was talking.
 
  Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!' 
</span>
on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his 
</span>
  `A nice muddle their slates'll be in 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</span>
 
  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it 
</span>
  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was 
Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of 
 so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write 
with one finger for the rest of the day;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:-- 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, 
</span>
          All on a summer day: 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>      The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, 
</span>
          And took them quite away!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.</span>
 
  `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a great deal to come before that!' 
</span>
 
  `Call the first witness,' said the King;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First 
</span>
witness!' 
 
  The first witness was the Hatter.
one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in:  but I 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.' 
</span>
 
  `You ought to have finished,' said the King.
begin?' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into 
</span>
the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.
think it was,' he said.
 
  `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.
 
  `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.</span>
 
  `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who 
</span>
instantly made a memorandum of the fact.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;</span>
`I've none of my own.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.</span>
 
  `Give your evidence,' said the King;
I'll have you executed on the spot.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all:  he kept 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his 
</span>
teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which 
</span>
puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was:  she was 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she 
</span>
would get up and leave the court;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for 
</span>
her.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was 
</span>
  `I can hardly breathe.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly:  `you know 
</span>
you're growing too.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`not in that ridiculous fashion.'  And he got up very sulkily 
</span>
and crossed over to the other side of the court.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter 
</span>
trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>you executed, whether you're nervous or not.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and 
</span>
the twinkling of the tea--' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.</span>
`Do you take me for a dunce?
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.</span>
 
  `You did!' said the Hatter.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I deny it!' said the March Hare.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `He denies it,' said the King:  `leave out that part.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:  but the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread- 
</span>
and-butter--' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you 
</span>
executed.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, 
</span>
  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he 
began.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately 
</span>
suppressed by the officers of the court.
hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat 
</span>
upon it.) 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant 
</span>
till now.' 
 
  `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' 
continued the King.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter:  `I'm on the floor, as 
</span>
it is.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</span>
 
  `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.
shall get on better.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one 
</span>
of the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before the 
officer could get to the door.
 
  `Call the next witness!' said the King.
 
  The next witness was the Duchess's cook.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began 
</span>
sneezing all at once.
 
  `Give your evidence,' said the King.
 
  `Shan't,' said the cook.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.' 
</span>
 
  `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What 
</span>
are tarts made of?' 
 
  `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.</span>
 
  `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.
  Turn that Dormouse out of court!
  Off with his whiskers!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down 
</span>
again, the cook had disappeared.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Call the next witness.'  And he added in an undertone to the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.</span>
It quite makes my forehead ache!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, 
</span>
feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, 
`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!' 
</span>
 
 
 
                           CHAPTER XII 
 
                        Alice's Evidence 
 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset 
</span>
the week before.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places-- 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as 
</span>
he said do.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable 
</span>
  She soon got it out again, and put it right;
it signifies much,' she said to herself;
would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, 
</span>
gazing up into the roof of the court.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What do you know about this business?' the King said to 
</span>
Alice.
 
  `Nothing,' said Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.</span>
 
  `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.</span>
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant, your Majesty means, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and 
</span>
making faces at him as he spoke.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and 
</span>
went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant-- 
unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word 
sounded best.
 
  Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some 
`unimportant.'  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to 
 `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she 
thought to herself.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out 
</span>
from his book, `Rule Forty-two.
HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.' 
 
  Everybody looked at Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.</span>
 
  `You are,' said the King.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice:  `besides, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>that's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling 
</span>
voice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said 
</span>
the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry;
just been picked up.' 
 
  `What's in it?' said the Queen.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.' 
</span>
 
  `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was 
written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.</span>
 
  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set 
</span>
of verses.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of 
</span>
the jurymen.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.) 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.</span>
(The jury all brightened up again.) 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the 
</span>
  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>have signed your name like an honest man.' 
</span>
 
  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the 
first really clever thing the King had said that day.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.</span>
 
  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.
even know what they're about!' 
 
  `Read them,' said the King.
 
  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.
please your Majesty?' he asked.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>till you come to the end:  then stop.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:-- 
</span>
 
        `They told me you had been to her, 
          And mentioned me to him: 
        She gave me a good character, 
          But said I could not swim.
 
        He sent them word I had not gone 
          (We know it to be true): 
        If she should push the matter on, 
          What would become of you?
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>        I gave her one, they gave him two, 
</span>
          You gave us three or more;
        They all returned from him to you, 
          Though they were mine before.
 
        If I or she should chance to be 
          Involved in this affair, 
        He trusts to you to set them free, 
          Exactly as we were.
 
        My notion was that you had been 
          (Before she had this fit) 
        An obstacle that came between 
          Him, and ourselves, and it.
 
        Don't let him know she liked them best, 
          For this must ever be 
        A secret, kept from all the rest, 
          Between yourself and me.' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' 
</span>
said the King, rubbing his hands;
 
  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>believe there's an atom of meaning in it.' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to 
</span>
explain the paper.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.</span>
yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his 
knee, and looking at them with one eye;
meaning in them, after all.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.</span>
 
  The Knave shook his head sadly.
(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.) 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, 
</span>
that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--' 
 
  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said 
Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to 
</span>
the tarts on the table.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my 
</span>
dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the 
</span>
  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no 
</span>
 but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.) 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round 
</span>
the court with a smile.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</span>
 
  `No, no!' said the Queen.
 
  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.
the sentence first!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.</span>
 
  `I won't!' said Alice.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.</span>
Nobody moved.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!' 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the 
</span>
trees upon her face.
 
  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister;
sleep you've had!' 
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told 
</span>
her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange 
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she 
</span>
ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- 
</span>
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back 
</span>
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>around her became alive the strange creatures of her little 
</span>
sister's dream.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable 
</span>
Mock Turtle.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep- 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's 
</span>
heavy sobs.
 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager 
</span>
with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of 
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, 
</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</span>
