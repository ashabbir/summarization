(Alice had no idea what Latitude was, <br/>or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to <br/>say.) <br/> <br/>  Presently she began again.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon <br/>began talking again.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There was not a moment to be lost: <br/>away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it <br/>say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late <br/>it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the <br/>corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found <br/>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps <br/>hanging from the roof.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, <br/>and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the <br/>doors of the hall;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `and even if <br/>my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of <br/>very little use without my shoulders.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I think I could, if I only <br/>know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things <br/>had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few <br/>things indeed were really impossible.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <br/> <br/>         *       *       *       *       *       * <br/> <br/>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <br/> <br/>  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my <br/>going out altogether, like a candle.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But it's no <br/>use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to <br/>feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to <br/>find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally <br/>happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the <br/>way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, <br/>that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the <br/>common way.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <br/> <br/>         *       *       *       *       *       * <br/> <br/>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>                           CHAPTER II <br/> <br/>                        The Pool of Tears <br/> <br/> <br/>  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much <br/>surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good <br/>English);</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> --but I must be <br/>kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the <br/>way I want to go!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> won't she <br/>be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate <br/>that she was ready to ask help of any one;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>            `How cheerfully he seems to grin, <br/>              How neatly spread his claws, <br/>            And welcome little fishes in <br/>              With gently smiling jaws!' <br/> <br/>  `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and <br/>her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel <br/>after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little <br/>house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Tell me that first, and then, if I <br/>like being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down <br/>here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a <br/>sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads <br/>down!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  (Alice had <br/>been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general <br/>conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find <br/>a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in <br/>the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and <br/>behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that <br/>she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine <br/>feet high.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!' <br/>(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: <br/>she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having <br/>seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a <br/>mouse--a mouse--O mouse!')  The Mouse looked at her rather <br/>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little <br/>eyes, but it said nothing.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `I <br/>daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the <br/>Conqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had <br/>no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she <br/>began again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in <br/>her French lesson-book.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, I beg <br/>your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the <br/>poor animal's feelings.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Would YOU like cats if you were me?' <br/> <br/>  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone:  `don't be <br/>angry about it.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/>She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, <br/>as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so <br/>nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and <br/>she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital <br/>one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again, <br/>for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt <br/>certain it must be really offended.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Don't let me hear <br/>the name again!' <br/> <br/>  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the <br/>subject of conversation.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' <br/>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is <br/>such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Do come back <br/>again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't <br/>like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam <br/>slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice <br/>thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to <br/>the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll <br/>understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.' <br/> <br/>  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded <br/>with the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a <br/>Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious <br/>creatures.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the <br/>shore.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice kept her eyes <br/>anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad <br/>cold if she did not get dry very soon.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  But the insolence of his Normans--"  How are you <br/>getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it <br/>spoke.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> Prizes!' <br/> <br/>  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand <br/>in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt <br/>water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What else have <br/>you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/>`What are you thinking of?' <br/> <br/>  `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly:  `you had got to <br/>the fifth bend, I think?' <br/> <br/>  `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You insult me by talking such nonsense!' <br/> <br/>  `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You're enough to try the <br/>patience of an oyster!' <br/> <br/>  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, <br/>addressing nobody in particular.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts <br/>they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I <br/>wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice <br/>began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Where CAN I have <br/>dropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed in a moment that it was <br/>looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she <br/>very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were <br/>nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her <br/>swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and <br/>the little door, had vanished completely.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Quick, now!'  And Alice was so much frightened <br/>that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without <br/>trying to explain the mistake it had made.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on <br/>messages next!'  And she began fancying the sort of thing that <br/>would happen:  `"Miss Alice!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Only I don't think,' Alice went <br/>on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering <br/>people about like that!' <br/> <br/>  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with <br/>a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two <br/>or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and <br/>a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when <br/>her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking- <br/>glass.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  What WILL become of me?' <br/> <br/>  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full <br/>effect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable, <br/>and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting <br/>out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `at least there's no room to grow up any more <br/>HERE.' <br/> <br/>  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I <br/>am now?</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and <br/>she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she <br/>was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no <br/>reason to be afraid of it.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice heard it <br/>say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.' <br/> <br/>  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she <br/>fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly <br/>spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Why, it <br/>fills the whole window!' <br/> <br/>  `Sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's an arm for all that.' <br/> <br/>  `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate:  go and take it <br/>away!' <br/> <br/>  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear <br/>whispers now and then;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What a number of cucumber-frames there <br/>must be!' thought Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said <br/>Alice to herself.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and <br/>Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I'll set <br/>Dinah at you!' <br/> <br/>  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to <br/>herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  If they had any <br/>sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they <br/>began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A <br/>barrowful will do, to begin with.' <br/> <br/>  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> then Alice <br/>dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run <br/>over;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> then Alice, thinking it was very <br/>like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every <br/>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle <br/>again;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she <br/>leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself <br/>with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks <br/>very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice looked all round <br/>her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see <br/>anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under <br/>the circumstances.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice <br/>replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present-- <br/>at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think <br/>I must have been changed several times since then.' <br/> <br/>  `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's <br/>making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, <br/>very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.' <br/> <br/>  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and as Alice could not <br/>think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in <br/>a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I've something <br/>important to say!' <br/> <br/>  This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back <br/>again.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but <br/>at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth <br/>again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?' <br/> <br/>  `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to <br/>herself.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/> <br/>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <br/> <br/>         *       *       *       *       *       * <br/> <br/>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <br/> <br/>  `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of <br/>delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she <br/>found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could <br/>see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which <br/>seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay <br/>far below her.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Let me alone!' <br/> <br/>  `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more <br/>subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every <br/>way, and nothing seems to suit them!' <br/> <br/>  `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said <br/>Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There's no pleasing them!' <br/> <br/>  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no <br/>use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!' <br/> <br/>  `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was <br/>beginning to see its meaning.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Ugh, Serpent!' <br/> <br/>  `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I can see you're <br/>trying to invent something!' <br/> <br/>  `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she <br/>remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I suppose you'll be <br/>telling me next that you never tasted an egg!' <br/> <br/>  `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very <br/>truthful child;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `but if they do, why <br/>then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.' <br/> <br/>  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent <br/>for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of <br/>adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and <br/>what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a <br/>serpent?' <br/> <br/>  `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice crouched down among the <br/>trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled <br/>among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and <br/>untwist it.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and both footmen, <br/>Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their <br/>heads.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  For <br/>instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let <br/>you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time <br/>he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That's the <br/>first question, you know.' <br/> <br/>  It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I shall sit here,' he <br/>said, `on and off, for days and days.' <br/> <br/>  `But what am I to do?' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `and most of 'em do.' <br/> <br/>  `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, <br/>feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `and that's a fact.' <br/> <br/>  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought <br/>it would be as well to introduce some other subject of <br/>conversation.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn <br/>round on its axis--' <br/> <br/>  `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!' <br/> <br/>  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant <br/>to take the hint;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> wow!' <br/> <br/>  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept <br/>tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing <br/>howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:-- <br/> <br/>        `I speak severely to my boy, <br/>          I beat him when he sneezes;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said <br/>to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer- <br/>shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all <br/>directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `IF I <br/>don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure <br/>to kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave it <br/>behind?'  She said the last words out loud, and the little thing <br/>grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `that's not at all a proper way of expressing <br/>yourself.' <br/> <br/>  The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into <br/>its face to see what was the matter with it.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> also its eyes were getting extremely small for <br/>a baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at <br/>all.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `If you're going to turn into a pig, <br/>my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do <br/>with you.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `If it had grown up,' <br/>she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: <br/>but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.'  And she began <br/>thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as <br/>pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right <br/>way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing <br/>the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought <br/>Alice, and she went on.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Visit either you like:  they're both mad.' <br/> <br/>  `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  You're mad.' <br/> <br/>  `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  You grant <br/>that?' <br/> <br/>  `I suppose so,' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Therefore I'm mad.' <br/> <br/>  `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Do you play croquet <br/>with the Queen to-day?' <br/> <br/>  `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been <br/>invited yet.' <br/> <br/>  `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'd <br/>nearly forgotten to ask.' <br/> <br/>  `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had <br/>come back in a natural way.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  No room!' they cried <br/>out when they saw Alice coming.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `There's PLENTY of room!' said <br/>Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one <br/>end of the table.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  He had been <br/>looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was <br/>his first speech.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> but all <br/>he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?' <br/> <br/>  `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You might just <br/>as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat <br/>what I see"!' <br/> <br/>  `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I <br/>like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!' <br/> <br/>  `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to <br/>be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the <br/>same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!' <br/> <br/>  `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the <br/>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, <br/>while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and <br/>writing-desks, which wasn't much.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What day of <br/>the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice:  he had taken his <br/>watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking <br/>it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter <br/>grumbled:  `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.' <br/> <br/>  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then <br/>he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he <br/>could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It <br/>was the BEST butter, you know.' <br/> <br/>  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Does YOUR watch tell <br/>you what year it is?' <br/> <br/>  `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily:  `but that's <br/>because it stays the same year for such a long time together.' <br/> <br/>  `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> just what I was going to <br/>remark myself.' <br/> <br/>  `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to <br/>Alice again.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It's HIM.' <br/> <br/>  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!' <br/> <br/>  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to <br/>beat time when I learn music.' <br/> <br/>  `Ah!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Half-past one, time for dinner!' <br/> <br/>  (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a <br/>whisper.) <br/> <br/>  `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: <br/>`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.' <br/> <br/>  `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could keep <br/>it to half-past one as long as you liked.' <br/> <br/>  `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It's always six o'clock now.' <br/> <br/>  A bright idea came into Alice's head.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I vote the young lady <br/>tells us a story.' <br/> <br/>  `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at <br/>the proposal.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and they lived at the bottom of a well--' <br/> <br/>  `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great <br/>interest in questions of eating and drinking.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `VERY ill.' <br/> <br/>  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways <br/>of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went <br/>on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?' <br/> <br/>  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very <br/>earnestly.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so <br/>I can't take more.' <br/> <br/>  `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very <br/>easy to take MORE than nothing.' <br/> <br/>  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why did they live at the <br/>bottom of a well?' <br/> <br/>  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and <br/>then said, `It was a treacle-well.' <br/> <br/>  `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but <br/>the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> sh!' and the Dormouse <br/>sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the <br/>story for yourself.' <br/> <br/>  `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And so these three little sisters--they <br/>were learning to draw, you know--' <br/> <br/>  `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Hatter was the <br/>only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a <br/>good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset <br/>the milk-jug into his plate.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `so <br/>I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, <br/>stupid?' <br/> <br/>  `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not <br/>choosing to notice this last remark.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `--well in.' <br/> <br/>  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse <br/>go on for some time without interrupting it.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `and they drew <br/>all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--' <br/> <br/>  `Why with an M?' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up <br/>again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an <br/>M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness-- <br/>you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever <br/>see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?' <br/> <br/>  `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I <br/>don't think--' <br/> <br/>  `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice thought this a very curious <br/>thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up <br/>to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice <br/>looked round, eager to see the Queen.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Next <br/>came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice <br/>recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous <br/>manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without <br/>noticing her.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and, <br/>turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?' <br/> <br/>  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very <br/>politely;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, <br/>three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate <br/>gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Can you play croquet?' <br/> <br/>  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question <br/>was evidently meant for her.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  He <br/>looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised <br/>himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and <br/>whispered `She's under sentence of execution.' <br/> <br/>  `What for?' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice gave a <br/>little scream of laughter.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice thought she had never seen such a <br/>curious croquet-ground in her life;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her <br/>flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, <br/>comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, <br/>but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened <br/>out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it <br/>WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a <br/>puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: <br/>and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, <br/>it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled <br/>itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this, <br/>there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she <br/>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers <br/>were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the <br/>ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very <br/>difficult game indeed.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's no <br/>use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at <br/>least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared, <br/>and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the <br/>game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather <br/>a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't <br/>hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in <br/>particular;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me <br/>to introduce it.' <br/> <br/>  `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: <br/>`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.' <br/> <br/>  `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, <br/>which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one <br/>of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her <br/>flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where <br/>Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up <br/>into a tree.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  I can't tell you just now what the moral of that <br/>is, but I shall remember it in a bit.' <br/> <br/>  `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Everything's got a <br/>moral, if only you can find it.'  And she squeezed herself up <br/>closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, <br/>digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, <br/>`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the <br/>sounds will take care of themselves."' <br/> <br/>  `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to <br/>herself.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Shall I try the <br/>experiment?' <br/> <br/>  `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all <br/>anxious to have the experiment tried.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the <br/>less there is of yours."' <br/> <br/>  `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this <br/>last remark, `it's a vegetable.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `and the moral of <br/>that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put <br/>more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than <br/>what it might appear to others that what you were or might have <br/>been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared <br/>to them to be otherwise."' <br/> <br/>  `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very <br/>politely, `if I had it written down:  but I can't quite follow it <br/>as you say it.' <br/> <br/>  `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess <br/>replied, in a pleased tone.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I make you <br/>a present of everything I've said as yet.' <br/> <br/>  `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was <br/>beginning to feel a little worried.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice looked up, <br/>and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, <br/>frowning like a thunderstorm.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and Alice <br/>was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her <br/>back to the croquet-ground.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to <br/>Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?' <br/> <br/>  `No,' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and she walked off, <br/>leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice did not quite like <br/>the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would <br/>be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage <br/>Queen:  so she waited.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What fun!' <br/>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> here,' thought Alice, as she went <br/>slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life, <br/>never!' <br/> <br/>  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the <br/>distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, <br/>as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart <br/>would break.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice <br/>thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he <br/>doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was very <br/>nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your <br/>interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be <br/>more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call <br/>him Tortoise--' <br/> <br/>  `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and then they both sat silent and <br/>looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Now at OURS they had at the <br/>end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."' <br/> <br/>  `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I only took the regular course.' <br/> <br/>  `What was that?' inquired Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `and then the different branches of Arithmetic-- <br/>Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.' <br/> <br/>  `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You know what to beautify is, <br/>I suppose?' <br/> <br/>  `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.' <br/> <br/>  `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to <br/>uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.' <br/> <br/>  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about <br/>it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you <br/>to learn?' <br/> <br/>  `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting <br/>off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern, <br/>with Seaography:  then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old <br/>conger-eel, that used to come once a week:  HE taught us <br/>Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.' <br/> <br/>  `What was THAT like?' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for <br/>a minute or two sobs choked his voice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  At last the Mock Turtle recovered <br/>his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on <br/>again:-- <br/> <br/>  `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)-- <br/>`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--' <br/>(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, <br/>and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful <br/>thing a Lobster Quadrille is!' <br/> <br/>  `No, indeed,' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> and the two creatures, <br/>who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat <br/>down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I've forgotten the words.' <br/> <br/>  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now <br/>and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and <br/>waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle <br/>sang this, very slowly and sadly:-- <br/> <br/> <br/>`"Will you walk a little faster?"</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/>    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the <br/>         dance?"' <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>  `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said <br/>Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last:  `and I do so <br/>like that curious song about the whiting!' <br/> <br/>  `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've <br/>seen them, of course?' <br/> <br/>  `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she <br/>checked herself hastily.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but <br/>if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're <br/>like.' <br/> <br/>  `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  That's all.' <br/> <br/>  `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Do you know why it's called a whiting?' <br/> <br/>  `I never thought about it,' said Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I <br/>mean, what makes them so shiny?' <br/> <br/>  Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she <br/>gave her answer.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Now you know.' <br/> <br/>  `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great <br/>curiosity.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather <br/>impatiently:  `any shrimp could have told you that.' <br/> <br/>  `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were <br/>still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep <br/>back, please:  we don't want YOU with us!"' <br/> <br/>  `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle <br/>said:  `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.' <br/> <br/>  `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR <br/>adventures.' <br/> <br/>  `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' <br/>said Alice a little timidly:  `but it's no use going back to <br/>yesterday, because I was a different person then.' <br/> <br/>  `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an <br/>impatient tone:  `explanations take such a dreadful time.' <br/> <br/>  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when <br/>she first saw the White Rabbit.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Tell her to begin.'  He looked at the Gryphon as <br/>if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `but it <br/>sounds uncommon nonsense.' <br/> <br/>  Alice said nothing;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How COULD <br/>he turn them out with his nose, you know?' <br/> <br/>  `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It's by far <br/>the most confusing thing I ever heard!' <br/> <br/>  `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon:  and <br/>Alice was only too glad to do so.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you <br/>a song?' <br/> <br/>  `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' <br/>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather <br/>offended tone, `Hm!</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large <br/>dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice <br/>quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,' <br/>she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!'  But there seemed <br/>to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about <br/>her, to pass away the time.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve <br/>creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because <br/>some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they <br/>are the jurors.'  She said this last word two or three times over <br/>to herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and <br/>rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the <br/>meaning of it at all.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `They <br/>can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.' <br/> <br/>  `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in <br/>reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the <br/>trial.' <br/> <br/>  `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but <br/>she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in <br/>the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked <br/>anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `A nice muddle their slates'll be in <br/>before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This of course, <br/>Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got <br/>behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it <br/>away.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I can hardly breathe.' <br/> <br/>  `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing.' <br/> <br/>  `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  They had <br/>a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: <br/>into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat <br/>upon it.) <br/> <br/>  `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She carried the <br/>pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before <br/>she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began <br/>sneezing all at once.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/>Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top <br/>of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!' <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>                           CHAPTER XII <br/> <br/>                        Alice's Evidence <br/> <br/> <br/>  `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the <br/>moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she <br/>jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with <br/>the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads <br/>of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding <br/>her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset <br/>the week before.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE <br/>HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.' <br/> <br/>  Everybody looked at Alice.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `so now let the jury--' <br/> <br/>  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had <br/>grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit <br/>afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> `Why, what a long <br/>sleep you've had!' <br/> <br/>  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told <br/>her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange <br/>Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about;</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> it's <br/>getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she <br/>ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.</span><span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> <br/> <br/>  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her <br/>head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of <br/>little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began <br/>dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- <br/> <br/>  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the <br/>tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes <br/>were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her <br/>voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back <br/>the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and <br/>still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place <br/>around her became alive the strange creatures of her little <br/>sister's dream.</span>
