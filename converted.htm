but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-

her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never 
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to 
take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the 
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop

that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude

or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to 
time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall 
have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.

But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get

  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a 
moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead;
was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in 
away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it 
say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late 
it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the 
corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found 
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps 
  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, 
  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of 
the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of 
curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little 
door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key 
in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small 
passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and 
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about 
among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but 
my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of

  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she 
went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on 
it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like 
telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which 
certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck 
of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME' 
beautifully printed on it in large letters.

for she had read several nice little histories about children who 
had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant 
their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker 
finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds;
never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 
`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or 
  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured 
to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort 
of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast 
turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished

her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right 
size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.

like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember

quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb

  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to 
She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very 
seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so 
trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game 
of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious 
use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!
  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under 
the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on 
which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.
`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger, 
  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which

find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally 
happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the 
way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, 
that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the

kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the

  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in 
fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took 
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.

  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the 
distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.
It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a 
pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the 
other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to 
be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate

sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid 
gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard 
  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very 
hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age 
  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such 
long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all;
sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,

strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--

as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, 
and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the 
cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it 
hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at 
the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in

been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general 
conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find 
a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in 
the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and 
behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that 
she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine 
  `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, 
little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at

no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she

I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, 
as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so 
nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and 
she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital 
one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again, 
for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt

  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the 
The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is 
such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!

can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you 
know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!
He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a 
sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the 
Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and 
again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't 
like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam 
slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice 
thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to 
the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll 
understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'

bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their 
fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and 
had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed 
quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with 
quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, 
and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';
and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,

  First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the 
exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party

and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know

out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting, 
  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of 
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon 
its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, 
in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.
  `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices 
  `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with 
  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand 
in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt 
water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.
  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.
  `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.

  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked

  The next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise 
and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not 
taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on 
in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

  `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up

  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'

Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one old Magpie began 
wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be

  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a 
wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice 
began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.
In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of 
footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping 
that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to

looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she

the little door, had vanished completely.
  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,

As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door 
upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, 
and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and

  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with 
a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two 
or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and 
a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when 
her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-

effect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable, 
and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting 
out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and 
waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what 
sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close 
above her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one 
sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.
  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes 
Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the 
hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold 
up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?

  `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.
  `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice;
  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to 
sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they 
began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A 
doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came

  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and 
about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over 
her head made her look up in a great hurry.
  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round 
eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.
`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried 
time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it 
would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.
  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of 
stick, and held it out to the puppy;

way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat 
down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its 
mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;
so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out 
of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the

  `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because

politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with;

very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'

a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.
  This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back

  `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.
  `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it 
all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
  `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.
  Alice folded her hands, and began:-- 
    `You are old, Father William,' the young man said, 
      `And your hair has become very white;
    `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son, 
      `I feared it might injure the brain;

    `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,' 
  `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar 
  `What size do you want to be?' it asked.
  `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;

  `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.
  `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you 
wouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched

angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three

delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she 
found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could 
see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which 
seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay

had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a 
hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating

`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come

not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself 
  For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and 
wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came 
running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman 
because he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face only, 
she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door

  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into 
ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and 
inside, no one could possibly hear you.'  And certainly there was 
a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling 
and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish

  `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--' 
  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate 
came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just 
grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees 
  `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, 
  `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

  `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.
  `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 
`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.
  The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of 
smoke from one end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a 
leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to

sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.
and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from 
ear to ear.
  `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for 
speak first, `why your cat grins like that?' 
  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice 
  `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, 
  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought

  `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up 
  `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a 
hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it 
  `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very 
glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her 
  `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!' 
  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant

singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a 
violent shake at the end of every line: 
        `Speak roughly to your little boy, 
  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept 
tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing 
howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--

  `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat:  `we're all mad here.
  `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.
  `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.' 
  `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad.
  `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's

  Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used

  `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.

did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the

then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself 
  There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, 
and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it:  a 
Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two 
were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking 
`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.' 
  The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded 
Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one

they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were 
trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.

to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it 
in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down 
the little passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the 
beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.
  A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the 
roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at 
  On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!
  `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.
  `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it 
was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.' 
  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all 
the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as 
she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the 
others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.

have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;

feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers;

came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice 
recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous 
King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion;
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on 
her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember 
what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people 
  When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped 
and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?' 
She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
  `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently;
turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?' 
  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very 
  `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three 
gardeners who were lying round the rosetree;
they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs 
was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether 
they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her 
  `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.
  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her 
for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!
  `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the

  `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the 
three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the 
King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.
  `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, 
going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--' 
  `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the 
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate 
gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.
  `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a

  `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers 
  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question 
  `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the 
  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.
She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously 
  `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?' 
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised 
himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and 
whispered `She's under sentence of execution.' 
  `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.
  `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.
  `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, 
and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up 
 the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live 
flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to 
stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her 
flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, 
comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, 
but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened 
out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it 
WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a 
puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: 
it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled 
itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this, 
there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she 
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers 
ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very

and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the 
game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.

he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!

  This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a

  `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.

  `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)--

down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

  Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would

    `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, 
    How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--' 
        [later editions continued as follows 
    The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, 
    While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
    When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, 
    Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: 
    While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,

  `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon:  and 
  `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the 
  `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' 
Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather 
"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?' 
  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes 
choked with sobs, to sing this:-- 
    `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green, 
    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
        Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
  `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had 
just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!' 
  `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, 
it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.
  `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran;
only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more 
faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the 
        Beautiful, beautiful Soup!' 
  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when 
they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts 
of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: 
the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on 
with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the 
dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice 
quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,' 
she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!'  But there seemed

  `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in 
reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the 
  `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but 
she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in 
the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked 
shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!' 
didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his

Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got 
behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it 
little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
  `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.
  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and 
then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:-- 
    `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, 
      The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,

a great deal to come before that!' 
blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First 
pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in:  but I 
hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.' 
  The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into 
  `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury 
eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then 
added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
  `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.
  `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who 
  `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;
  Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the 
Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.
  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all:  he kept 
shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the 
Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his

  `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was 
  `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing.' 
  `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.
  `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly:  `you know 
  `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 
`not in that ridiculous fashion.'  And he got up very sulkily 
  All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the 
Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to 
one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the 
singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter 
  `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have 
you executed, whether you're nervous or not.' 
  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a 
trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week 
or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and 
  `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.
  `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.
  `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.
  `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things 
twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--' 
  `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
  `I deny it!' said the March Hare.
  `He denies it,' said the King:  `leave out that part.' 
  `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, 
looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:  but the 
Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.
  `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread- 
  `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.
  `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.
  `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you 
  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, 
  `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.

  `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.
  Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
  `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious 
look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
  `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the 
court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.
  `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one 
pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before 
she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began

his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What 
  `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.
  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the 
Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down 
  `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.
`Call the next witness.'  And he added in an undertone to the 
Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.
  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, 
Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top 
of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!' 
  `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the 
moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she 
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with 
the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads 
of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding 
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset 
  `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great 
dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, 
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and 
she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once 
and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.
  `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave 
voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places-- 
ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as 
  Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she 
had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing 
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable 
  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of 
being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and 
handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write 
out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed 
too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, 
  `What do you know about this business?' the King said to 
  `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.
  `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.
the White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant, your Majesty means, 
of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and 
  `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and 
  At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily 
writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out 
  `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.
  `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.
  `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice:  `besides, 
that's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.' 
  `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
  `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.
  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.
`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling 
  `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said 
  `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems 
to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.' 
  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.

as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set 
  `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of 
  `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the 
queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.) 
  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.
  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and 
they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.' 
  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the

  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.
  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on

  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--

there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to

  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering 
over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's 
the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, 
  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to

  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the 
writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no

  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round 
  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and 
everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the 
King said, for about the twentieth time that day.
  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.
  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full 
size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!' 
  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying 
down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half 
of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on 
the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently 
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the

when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a 
curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea;
getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she 
  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her 
head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of 
little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began 
dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- 
  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the 
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes 
were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her 
voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back 
still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place 
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little 
  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried 
by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the 
neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as 
the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, 
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate 
guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the 
Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once 
more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's 
slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, 
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable 
  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in 
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and 
all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only 
rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the 
reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep- 
bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd 
boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and 
all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the 
confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the 
cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's 
  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of 
hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman;
she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and 
loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about 
her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager 
Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their 
simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, 
remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
