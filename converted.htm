                            CHAPTER I <br/>
 <br/>
                      Down the Rabbit-Hole <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister <br/></span>
on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,' <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</span>
 <br/>
  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to <br/></span>
itself, `Oh dear!
  Oh dear!
it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT- <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop <br/></span>
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once <br/></span>
considering how in the world she was to get out again.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself <br/></span>
falling down a very deep well.
 <br/>
  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she <br/>
had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to <br/>
wonder what was going to happen next.
down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to <br/>
 then she looked at the sides of the well, and <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing <br/></span>
somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she <br/>
fell past it.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I <br/></span>
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!
all think me at home!
even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely <br/>
true.) <br/>
 <br/>
  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for, <br/></span>
you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her <br/>
lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good <br/>
opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to <br/>
listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes, <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to <br/></span>
say.) <br/>
 <br/>
  `I wonder if I shall fall right <br/>
  How funny it'll seem to come out among the <br/>
people that walk with their heads downward!
think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling <br/></span>
  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon <br/>
  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>should think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember <br/></span>
her saucer of milk at tea-time.
  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>way, `Do cats eat bats?</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either <br/></span>
question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>bat?' when suddenly, thump!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in <br/></span>
sight, hurrying down it.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps <br/></span>
hanging from the roof.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;</span>
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, <br/></span>
wondering how she was ever to get out again.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of <br/></span>
 there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, <br/>
and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the <br/>
doors of the hall;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of <br/></span>
  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but <br/></span>
she could not even get her head though the doorway;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of <br/></span>
very little use without my shoulders.
I could shut up like a telescope!
know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few <br/></span>
things indeed were really impossible.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME' <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>beautifully printed on it in large letters.</span>
 <br/>
  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little <br/>
Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>for she had read several nice little histories about children who <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant <br/></span>
things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker <br/></span>
will burn you if you hold it too long;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or <br/></span>
later.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished <br/></span>
it off.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>         *       *       *       *       *       * <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice;
like a telescope.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.</span>
First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about <br/></span>
 `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my <br/>
going out altogether, like a candle.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember <br/></span>
ever having seen such a thing.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided <br/></span>
 but, alas for poor Alice!
when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, <br/></span>
she found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb <br/></span>
up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the poor little thing sat down and cried.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to <br/></span>
 `I advise you to leave off this minute!' <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so <br/></span>
severely as to bring tears into her eyes;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious <br/></span>
child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!</span>
there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable <br/>
person!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger, <br/></span>
 and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep <br/>
 so either way I'll get into the garden, and I <br/>
don't care which happens!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which <br/></span>
  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the <br/></span>
common way.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>         *       *       *       *       *       * <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <br/></span>
 <br/>

                           CHAPTER II <br/>
 <br/>
                        The Pool of Tears <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good <br/></span>
 `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that <br/>
  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so <br/></span>
  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on <br/>
your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself <br/>
about you:  you must manage the best way you can;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the <br/></span>
  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of <br/>
boots every Christmas.' <br/>
 <br/>
  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.
`They must go by the carrier,' she thought;
seem, sending presents to one's own feet!
directions will look!
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>            ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</span>
                HEARTHRUG, <br/>
                    NEAR THE FENDER, <br/>
                        (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).
 <br/>
Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</span>
 <br/>
  Poor Alice!
  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>side, to look through into the garden with one eye;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>through was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to <br/></span>
cry again.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great <br/></span>
girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in <br/>
  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the <br/></span>
hall.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to <br/></span>
 the Duchess, the Duchess!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate <br/></span>
that she was ready to ask help of any one;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard <br/></span>
as he could go.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: <br/></span>
`Dear, dear!
  How queer everything is to-day!
  I wonder if I've been changed in <br/>
the night?
  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this <br/>
  I almost think I can remember feeling a little <br/>
  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in <br/>
  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age <br/></span>
as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of <br/>
them.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, <br/></span>
 she knows such a very little!
and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!
  Let me see:  four times five is twelve, <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!</span>
I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Multiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, <br/></span>
and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!
  I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:-- <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>            `How doth the little crocodile <br/></span>
              Improve his shining tail, <br/>
            And pour the waters of the Nile <br/>
              On every golden scale!
 <br/>
            `How cheerfully he seems to grin, <br/>
              How neatly spread his claws, <br/>
            And welcome little fishes in <br/>
              With gently smiling jaws!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little <br/></span>
house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh!
many lessons to learn!
  No, I've made up my mind about it;
Mabel, I'll stay down here!
heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!"
  Tell me that first, and then, if I <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads <br/></span>
  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!' <br/>
 <br/>
  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little <br/></span>
white kid gloves while she was talking.
  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in <br/></span>
 `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>back to the little door:  but, alas!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`for I never was so small as this before, never!</span>
it's too bad, that it is!' <br/>
 <br/>
  As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another <br/>
 she was up to her chin in salt water.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that <br/></span>
case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine <br/></span>
feet high.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, <br/></span>
trying to find her way out.
suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!
  However, everything is queer to-day.' <br/>
 <br/>
  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at <br/></span>
first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then <br/>
she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that <br/>
it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this <br/></span>
  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>think very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>trying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of <br/></span>
  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!' <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: <br/></span>
she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>mouse--a mouse--O mouse!')  The Mouse looked at her rather <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little <br/></span>
eyes, but it said nothing.
 <br/>
  `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Conqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>began again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in <br/></span>
  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the <br/>
water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the <br/></span>
poor animal's feelings.
  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate <br/></span>
  `Would YOU like cats if you were me?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone:  `don't be <br/></span>
  And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt <br/></span>
  `We won't talk about her any <br/>
more if you'd rather not.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end <br/></span>
  `As if I would talk on such a subject!
always HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!
the name again!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the <br/></span>
  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly <br/></span>
  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and <br/></span>
making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
 <br/>
  So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded <br/></span>
with the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious <br/></span>
  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the <br/>
shore.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
                           CHAPTER III <br/>
 <br/>
                  A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and <br/></span>
uncomfortable.
 <br/>
  The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with <br/></span>
them, as if she had known them all her life.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no <br/></span>
more to be said.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among <br/></span>
them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>soon make you dry enough!'  They all sat down at once, in a large <br/></span>
ring, with the Mouse in the middle.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad <br/></span>
cold if she did not get dry very soon.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?</span>
This is the driest thing I know.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been <br/></span>
of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very <br/></span>
politely:  `Did you speak?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.</span>
 <br/>
  `I thought you did,' said the Mouse.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found <br/></span>
it advisable--"' <br/>
 <br/>
  `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course you <br/></span>
know what "it" means.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said <br/></span>
the Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm.
what did the archbishop find?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William <br/></span>
and offer him the crown.
  But the insolence of his Normans--"  How are you <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it <br/></span>
spoke.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn't <br/></span>
seem to dry me at all.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more <br/></span>
energetic remedies--' <br/>
 <br/>
  `Speak English!' said the Eaglet.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>either!'  And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: <br/></span>
some of the other birds tittered audibly.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.' <br/></span>
(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.) <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party <br/></span>
were placed along the course, here and there.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know <br/></span>
  However, when they had been running half <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting, <br/></span>
and asking, `But who has won?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.</span>
last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have <br/>
prizes.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices <br/></span>
asked.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with <br/></span>
 and the whole party at once crowded round her, <br/>
calling out in a confused way, `Prizes!
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</span>
There was exactly one a-piece all round.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.</span>
 <br/>
  `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.
you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.</span>
 <br/>
  `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.
 <br/>
  Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of <br/></span>
this elegant thimble';
 and, when it had finished this short <br/>
speech, they all cheered.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked <br/></span>
so grave that she did not dare to laugh;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, <br/></span>
looking as solemn as she could.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on <br/></span>
the back.
  However, it was over at last, and they sat down again <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half <br/></span>
afraid that it would be offended again.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to <br/></span>
Alice, and sighing.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with <br/></span>
wonder at the Mouse's tail;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so <br/></span>
that her idea of the tale was something like this:-- <br/>
 <br/>
                    `Fury said to a <br/>
                   mouse, That he <br/>
                 met in the <br/>
               house, <br/>
            "Let us <br/>
              both go to <br/>
                law:  I will <br/>
                  prosecute <br/>
                    YOU.
  --Come, <br/>
                       I'll take no <br/>
                        denial;
                     must have a <br/>
                 trial:  For <br/>
              really this <br/>
           morning I've <br/>
          nothing <br/>
         to do."
           Said the <br/>
             mouse to the <br/>
               cur, "Such <br/>
                 a trial, <br/>
                   dear Sir, <br/>
                         With <br/>
                     no jury <br/>
                  or judge, <br/>
                would be <br/>
              wasting <br/>
             our <br/>
              breath."
               "I'll be <br/>
                 judge, I'll <br/>
                   be jury," <br/>
                         Said <br/>
                    cunning <br/>
                      old Fury: <br/>
                     "I'll <br/>
                      try the <br/>
                         whole <br/>
                          cause, <br/>
                             and <br/>
                        condemn <br/>
                       you <br/>
                      to <br/>
                       death."' <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.</span>
`What are you thinking of?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly:  `you had got to <br/></span>
the fifth bend, I think?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and <br/></span>
  `Oh, do let me help to undo it!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up <br/></span>
  `You insult me by talking such nonsense!' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice.
offended, you know!' <br/>
 <br/>
  The Mouse only growled in reply.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after <br/></span>
 and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little <br/></span>
quicker.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it <br/></span>
 and an old Crab took the opportunity of <br/>
saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>never to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the <br/></span>
young Crab, a little snappishly.
patience of an oyster!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, <br/></span>
  `She'd soon fetch it back!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' <br/></span>
said the Lory.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about <br/></span>
her pet:  `Dinah's our cat.
catching mice you can't think!
after the birds!
  Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look <br/>
at it!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one old Magpie began <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be <br/></span>
 the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my <br/></span>
  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a <br/></span>
melancholy tone.
  `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm <br/>
sure she's the best cat in the world!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to <br/></span>
finish his story.

                           CHAPTER IV <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>                The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill <br/></span>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and <br/></span>
looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!</span>
Oh my dear paws!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>dropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed in a moment that it was <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she <br/></span>
very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were <br/>
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the little door, had vanished completely.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE <br/></span>
  Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of <br/>
  Quick, now!'  And Alice was so much frightened <br/>
that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without <br/>
trying to explain the mistake it had made.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door <br/></span>
of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W.
  She went in without knocking, and hurried <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and <br/></span>
gloves.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going <br/></span>
  I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>messages next!'  And she began fancying the sort of thing that <br/></span>
  Come here directly, and get ready <br/>
 "Coming in a minute, nurse!
  Only I don't think,' Alice went <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering <br/></span>
people about like that!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking- <br/></span>
  There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,' <br/>
but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself, <br/></span>
`whenever I eat or drink anything;
  I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being <br/></span>
  She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so <br/></span>
much!' <br/>
 <br/>
  Alas!
 it was too late to wish that!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in <br/></span>
another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the <br/></span>
other arm curled round her head.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more, <br/></span>
whatever happens.
  What WILL become of me?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>effect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about <br/></span>
by mice and rabbits.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know, <br/></span>
this sort of life!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a <br/></span>
 `at least there's no room to grow up any more <br/>
HERE.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I <br/></span>
  That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman-- <br/>
but then--always to have lessons to learn!
 <br/>
  `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself.
learn lessons in here?
room at all for any lesson-books!' <br/>
 <br/>
  And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, <br/>
and making quite a conversation of it altogether;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</span>
 <br/>
  Mary Ann!' said the voice.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>this moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on the <br/></span>
  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no <br/></span>
reason to be afraid of it.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed <br/></span>
hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was <br/></span>
just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something <br/>
of the sort.
 <br/>
  Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>you?'  And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then <br/></span>
  Digging for apples, yer honour!' <br/>
 <br/>
  `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Come and help me out of THIS!'  (Sounds of more broken glass.) <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'  (He pronounced it `arrum.') <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `An arm, you goose!
fills the whole window!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's an arm for all that.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate:  go and take it <br/></span>
away!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear <br/></span>
 such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>honour, at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at <br/></span>
last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in <br/>
  This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more <br/>
sounds of broken glass.
must be!' thought Alice.
pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!
don't want to stay in here any longer!' <br/>
 <br/>
  She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  at <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>good many voices all talking together:  she made out the words: <br/></span>
`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;
 fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half <br/></span>
high enough yet--Oh!
 don't be particular-- <br/>
 catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind <br/>
that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go <br/></span>
down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't!
then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill!
go down the chimney!' <br/>
 <br/>
 So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said <br/>
  `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal:  this fireplace is <br/></span>
 but I THINK I can kick a little!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>above her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?</span>
  Tell us all about it!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,' <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know <br/></span>
is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes <br/>
like a sky-rocket!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice;</span>
Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do.
Dinah at you!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to <br/></span>
herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A <br/></span>
barrowful will do, to begin with.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead <br/></span>
silence.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright <br/></span>
idea came into her head.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I <br/></span>
suppose.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find <br/></span>
that she began shrinking directly.
enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by <br/></span>
two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a <br/></span>
thick wood.
 <br/>
  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.</span>
I think that will be the best plan.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and <br/></span>
simply arranged;
 the only difficulty was, that she had not the <br/>
smallest idea how to set about it;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her head made her look up in a great hurry.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried <br/></span>
hard to whistle to it;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>stick, and held it out to the puppy;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, <br/></span>
and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run <br/></span>
 and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in <br/></span>
its hurry to get hold of it;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle <br/></span>
 then the puppy began a series of short charges at the <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the <br/></span>
distance.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks <br/></span>
very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!
  I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!
  I suppose I ought to eat or <br/>
 but the great question is, what?' <br/>
 <br/>
  The great question certainly was, what?
her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under <br/></span>
  There was a large mushroom growing near her, <br/>
about the same height as herself;
it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her <br/>
that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice <br/></span>
of her or of anything else.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
                            CHAPTER V <br/>
 <br/>
                    Advice from a Caterpillar <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>silence:  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</span>
 <br/>
  `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.
 <br/>
  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present-- <br/></span>
at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think <br/>
I must have been changed several times since then.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</span>
`Explain yourself!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because <br/></span>
I'm not myself, you see.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with;</span>
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.
 <br/>
  `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice;
when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>feel it a little queer, won't you?' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.
 <br/>
  `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.
 <br/>
  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the <br/>
  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.
 <br/>
  Here was another puzzling question;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</span>
 <br/>
  `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.
important to say!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back <br/></span>
again.
 <br/>
  `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as <br/></span>
she could.
 <br/>
  `No,' said the Caterpillar.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else <br/></span>
to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth <br/>
  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice folded her hands, and began:-- <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `You are old, Father William,' the young man said, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>      `And your hair has become very white;</span>
    And yet you incessantly stand on your head-- <br/>
      Do you think, at your age, it is right?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>      `I feared it might injure the brain;</span>
    But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none, <br/>
      Why, I do it again and again.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before, <br/></span>
      And have grown most uncommonly fat;
    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door-- <br/>
      Pray, what is the reason of that?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>      `I kept all my limbs very supple <br/></span>
    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box-- <br/>
      Allow me to sell you a couple?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak <br/></span>
      For anything tougher than suet;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak-- <br/></span>
      Pray how did you manage to do it?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law, <br/></span>
      And argued each case with my wife;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, <br/></span>
      Has lasted the rest of my life.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose <br/></span>
      That your eye was as steady as ever;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose-- <br/></span>
      What made you so awfully clever?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,' <br/></span>
 `don't give yourself airs!
    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
      Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!' <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
  `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.
 <br/>
  `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly;
words have got altered.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar <br/></span>
decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.
 <br/>
  The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What size do you want to be?' it asked.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;</span>
`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
 <br/>
  Alice said nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched <br/></span>
height to be.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three <br/></span>
inches high).
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so <br/></span>
easily offended!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and <br/></span>
the other side will make you grow shorter.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `One side of WHAT?
herself.
 <br/>
  `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had <br/>
asked it aloud;
 and in another moment it was out of sight.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a <br/></span>
minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her <br/></span>
foot!
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking <br/></span>
 so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hardly room to open her mouth;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</span>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>         *       *       *       *       *       * <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>     *       *       *       *       *       *       * <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay <br/></span>
far below her.
 <br/>
  `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice.
  And oh, my poor hands, how is it I <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>can't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the <br/></span>
distant green leaves.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, <br/></span>
  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which <br/></span>
she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating <br/></span>
her violently with its wings.
 <br/>
  `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.
 <br/>
  `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every <br/></span>
way, and nothing seems to suit them!' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said <br/>
Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've <br/></span>
tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her;
  There's no pleasing them!' <br/>
 <br/>
  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the <br/></span>
 `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and <br/>
  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was <br/></span>
beginning to see its meaning.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come <br/></span>
wriggling down from the sky!
 <br/>
  `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice.
a--' <br/>
 <br/>
  `Well!
  WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.
trying to invent something!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the <br/></span>
  `I've seen a good many little girls in my <br/>
time, but never ONE with such a neck as that!
  I suppose you'll be <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>telling me next that you never tasted an egg!' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very <br/></span>
 `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as <br/>
serpents do, you know.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon;
then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a <br/></span>
serpent?' <br/>
 <br/>
  `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily;
not looking for eggs, as it happens;
want YOURS:  I don't like them raw.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it <br/></span>
settled down again into its nest.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled <br/></span>
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and <br/>
  After a while she remembered that she still held the <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very <br/></span>
carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</span>
 <br/>
  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, <br/>
that it felt quite strange at first;
few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.
there's half my plan done now!
  I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to <br/>
  However, I've got back to my right size:  the next <br/>
thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be <br/>
done, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come <br/></span>
upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wits!'  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself <br/></span>
down to nine inches high.
 <br/>

                           CHAPTER VI <br/>
 <br/>
                         Pig and Pepper <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>because he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face only, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door <br/></span>
  It was opened by another footman in livery, <br/>
with a round face, and large eyes like a frog;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their <br/></span>
  She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>invitation from the Queen to play croquet.'  The Frog-Footman <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the <br/></span>
words a little, `From the Queen.
to play croquet.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled <br/></span>
together.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into <br/></span>
the wood for fear of their hearing her;
out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and <br/></span>
that for two reasons.
 secondly, because they're making such a noise <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>inside, no one could possibly hear you.'  And certainly there was <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish <br/></span>
or kettle had been broken to pieces.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went <br/></span>
on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.
instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time <br/></span>
he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.
perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself;
VERY nearly at the top of his head.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees <br/></span>
behind him.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, <br/></span>
exactly as if nothing had happened.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</span>
 <br/>
  `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman.
first question, you know.' <br/>
 <br/>
  It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the <br/></span>
creatures argue.
  It's enough to drive one crazy!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for <br/></span>
repeating his remark, with variations.
said, `on and off, for days and days.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `But what am I to do?' said Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>smoke from one end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a <br/></span>
three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to <br/></span>
be full of soup.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to <br/></span>
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
 <br/>
  There was certainly too much of it in the air.
Duchess sneezed occasionally;
 and as for the baby, it was <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.</span>
only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ear to ear.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for <br/></span>
she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>speak first, `why your cat grins like that?' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice <br/></span>
 but she saw in another moment that it was addressed <br/>
to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on <br/>
again:-- <br/>
 <br/>
  `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned;
didn't know that cats COULD grin.' <br/>
 <br/>
 `and most of 'em do.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, <br/></span>
feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.
 <br/>
  `You don't know much,' said the Duchess;
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought <br/></span>
it would be as well to introduce some other subject of <br/>
  While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby <br/></span>
--the fire-irons came first;
  The Duchess took no notice of them even when <br/>
 and the baby was howling so much already, that it <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up <br/></span>
and down in an agony of terror.
 as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very <br/>
nearly carried it off.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it <br/></span>
does.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her <br/></span>
  `Just think of what work it would make with the day <br/>
  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn <br/>
round on its axis--' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant <br/></span>
 but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and <br/>
seemed not to be listening, so she went on again:  `Twenty-four <br/>
hours, I THINK;
 <br/>
  `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>figures!'  And with that she began nursing her child again, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>violent shake at the end of every line: <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>        `Speak roughly to your little boy, <br/></span>
          And beat him when he sneezes: <br/>
        He only does it to annoy, <br/>
          Because he knows it teases.' <br/>
 <br/>
                    CHORUS.
 <br/>
    (In which the cook and the baby joined):-- <br/>
 <br/>
                `Wow!
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:-- <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>        `I speak severely to my boy, <br/></span>
          I beat him when he sneezes;
        For he can thoroughly enjoy <br/>
          The pepper when he pleases!' <br/>
 <br/>
                    CHORUS.
 <br/>
                `Wow!
 <br/>
 you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said <br/>
to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of <br/></span>
  The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, <br/>
but it just missed her.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer- <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all <br/></span>
directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, <br/></span>
and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, <br/>
so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much <br/>
as she could do to hold it.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its <br/></span>
undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave it <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>behind?'  She said the last words out loud, and the little thing <br/></span>
grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
 `that's not at all a proper way of expressing <br/>
yourself.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into <br/></span>
its face to see what was the matter with it.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout <br/></span>
 also its eyes were getting extremely small for <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at <br/></span>
  `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked <br/>
into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.
 <br/>
  `If you're going to turn into a pig, <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do <br/></span>
  Mind now!'  The poor little thing sobbed again (or <br/>
grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for <br/>
some while in silence.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I <br/></span>
to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted <br/>
again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some <br/>
  This time there could be NO mistake about it:  it was <br/>
neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be <br/>
quite absurd for her to carry it further.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to <br/></span>
see it trot away quietly into the wood.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.'  And she began <br/></span>
thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</span>
 <br/>
  The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>natured, she thought:  still it had VERY long claws and a great <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at <br/></span>
all know whether it would like the name:  however, it only <br/>
  `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought <br/>
  `Would you tell me, please, which way I <br/>
ought to go from here?' <br/>
 <br/>
  `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said <br/>
the Cat.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I don't much care where--' said Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk <br/></span>
long enough.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another <br/></span>
  `What sort of people live about here?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`lives a Hatter:  and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, <br/></span>
`lives a March Hare.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat:  `we're all mad here.</span>
I'm mad.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  Alice didn't think that proved it at all;
`And how do you know that you're mad?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad.</span>
that?' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I suppose so,' said Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's <br/></span>
angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.
pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</span>
 <br/>
  `Do you play croquet <br/>
with the Queen to-day?' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been <br/>
invited yet.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used <br/></span>
to queer things happening.
where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.
 <br/>
  `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat.
nearly forgotten to ask.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>come back in a natural way.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the <br/></span>
direction in which the March Hare was said to live.
 `the March Hare will be <br/>
much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.'  As she said <br/></span>
this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a <br/>
branch of a tree.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.</span>
 <br/>
  `I said pig,' replied Alice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>appearing and vanishing so suddenly:  you make one quite giddy.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `All right,' said the Cat;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</span>
 <br/>
  I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;
`but a grin without a cat!
saw in my life!' <br/>
 <br/>
  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>house of the March Hare:  she thought it must be the right house, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was <br/></span>
thatched with fur.
  It was so large a house, that she did not <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high:  even <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself <br/></span>
`Suppose it should be raving mad after all!
gone to see the Hatter instead!' <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
                           CHAPTER VII <br/>
 <br/>
                         A Mad Tea-Party <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it:  a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking <br/></span>
  `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded <br/></span>
together at one corner of it:  `No room!
out when they saw Alice coming.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one <br/></span>
end of the table.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it <br/></span>
  `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.
 <br/>
  `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice <br/></span>
angrily.
 <br/>
  `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being <br/>
invited,' said the March Hare.
 <br/>
  `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice;
great many more than three.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was <br/></span>
his first speech.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said <br/></span>
 `it's very rude.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this;</span>
he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?' <br/>
 <br/>
  `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she <br/></span>
added aloud.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' <br/></span>
said the March Hare.
 <br/>
  `Exactly so,' said Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.</span>
 <br/>
  `I do,' Alice hastily replied;
I say--that's the same thing, you know.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat <br/></span>
what I see"!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I <br/></span>
like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the <br/></span>
same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!' <br/>
 <br/>
  `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and <br/></span>
writing-desks, which wasn't much.
 <br/>
  The Hatter was the first to break the silence.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice:  he had taken his <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking <br/></span>
it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March <br/></span>
Hare.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.</span>
 <br/>
  `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>grumbled:  `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It <br/></span>
was the BEST butter, you know.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</span>
`What a funny watch!' she remarked.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter.
you what year it is?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily:  `but that's <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>because it stays the same year for such a long time together.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.
 <br/>
  Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.</span>
`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she <br/>
could.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a little hot tea upon its nose.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>opening its eyes, `Of course, of course;</span>
remark myself.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to <br/></span>
Alice again.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `what's the answer?' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.</span>
 <br/>
  `Nor I,' said the March Hare.
 <br/>
  Alice sighed wearily.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that <br/></span>
have no answers.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you <br/></span>
wouldn't talk about wasting IT.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head <br/></span>
  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>beat time when I learn music.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `He won't stand <br/>
  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do <br/>
almost anything you liked with the clock.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the <br/></span>
  Half-past one, time for dinner!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a <br/></span>
whisper.) <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could keep <br/></span>
it to half-past one as long as you liked.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</span>
 <br/>
  The Hatter shook his head mournfully.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>            "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</span>
            How I wonder what you're at!"
 <br/>
You know the song, perhaps?' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:-- <br/></span>
 <br/>
            "Up above the world you fly, <br/>
            Like a tea-tray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle--"' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that <br/></span>
they had to pinch it to make it stop.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the <br/></span>
time!
  Off with his head!"' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, <br/></span>
`he won't do a thing I ask!
 <br/>
  A bright idea came into Alice's head.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice <br/></span>
ventured to ask.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, <br/></span>
  I vote the young lady <br/>
tells us a story.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at <br/></span>
the proposal.
 <br/>
  `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.
Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.
 <br/>
  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>said in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word you fellows <br/></span>
were saying.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep <br/></span>
again before it's done.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the <br/></span>
Dormouse began in a great hurry;
 and they lived at the bottom of a well--' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>interest in questions of eating and drinking.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a <br/></span>
minute or two.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently <br/></span>
 `they'd have been ill.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `So they were,' said the Dormouse;
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways <br/></span>
of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very <br/></span>
earnestly.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so <br/></span>
I can't take more.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very <br/></span>
easy to take MORE than nothing.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked <br/></span>
triumphantly.
 <br/>
  Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the <br/></span>
Dormouse, and repeated her question.
bottom of a well?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and <br/></span>
then said, `It was a treacle-well.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but <br/></span>
the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the <br/></span>
story for yourself.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly;
  I dare say there may be ONE.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.</span>
  `And so these three little sisters--they <br/>
were learning to draw, you know--' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</span>
 <br/>
  `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this <br/>
time.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's all move <br/></span>
one place on.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather <br/></span>
unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.
only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset <br/></span>
the milk-jug into his plate.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began <br/></span>
very cautiously:  `But I don't understand.
the treacle from?' <br/>
 <br/>
  `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, <br/></span>
stupid?' <br/>
 <br/>
  `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not <br/>
choosing to notice this last remark.
 <br/>
  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse;
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse <br/></span>
go on for some time without interrupting it.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and <br/></span>
rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `Why with an M?' said Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why not?' said the March Hare.</span>
 <br/>
  Alice was silent.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going <br/></span>
 but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness-- <br/></span>
you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever <br/>
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I <br/></span>
don't think--' <br/>
 <br/>
  `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got <br/></span>
up in great disgust, and walked off;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she <br/></span>
picked her way through the wood.
ever was at in all my life!' <br/>
 <br/>
  Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a <br/>
door leading right into it.
`But everything's curious today.
  I think I may as well go in at once.' <br/>
And in she went.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the <br/></span>
  `Now, I'll manage better this time,' <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and unlocking the door that led into the garden.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the little passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</span>

                          CHAPTER VIII <br/>
 <br/>
                   The Queen's Croquet-Ground <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at <br/></span>
it, busily painting them red.
thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up <br/>
to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!
splashing paint over me like that!' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone;
my elbow.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!</span>
lay the blame on others!' <br/>
 <br/>
  `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!' <br/>
 <br/>
  `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are <br/></span>
painting those roses?' <br/>
 <br/>
  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;</span>
and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads <br/>
  So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who had been anxiously <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looking across the garden, called out `The Queen!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon <br/></span>
  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looked round, eager to see the Queen.</span>
 <br/>
  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers;</span>
ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the <br/>
  After these came the royal children;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous <br/></span>
manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without <br/>
  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember <br/></span>
ever having heard of such a rule at processions;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people <br/></span>
had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?' <br/>
So she stood still where she was, and waited.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?' <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very <br/></span>
 but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of <br/>
cards, after all.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>gardeners who were lying round the rosetree;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her <br/></span>
own children.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.</span>
`It's no business of MINE.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!</span>
Off--' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the <br/></span>
Queen was silent.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said <br/></span>
`Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave <br/></span>
`Turn them over!' <br/>
 <br/>
  The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</span>
 <br/>
  `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.
And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you <br/>
been doing here?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the <br/></span>
  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a <br/></span>
large flower-pot that stood near.
about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly <br/>
marched off after the others.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers <br/></span>
shouted in reply.
 <br/>
  `That's right!' shouted the Queen.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question <br/></span>
was evidently meant for her.
 <br/>
  `Yes!' shouted Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the <br/></span>
procession, wondering very much what would happen next.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously <br/></span>
into her face.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>whispered `She's under sentence of execution.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `What for?' said Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.</span>
I said "What for?"' <br/>
 <br/>
  `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.
  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a <br/>
  `The Queen will hear you!
rather late, and the Queen said--' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up <br/></span>
 however, they got settled down in a minute or <br/>
  Alice thought she had never seen such a <br/>
curious croquet-ground in her life;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'> the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: <br/></span>
and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers <br/></span>
were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very <br/></span>
difficult game indeed.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The players all played at once without waiting for turns, <br/></span>
quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with <br/></span>
her head!' about once in a minute.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as <br/></span>
yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of <br/></span>
  They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here;
wonder is, that there's any one left alive!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at <br/></span>
first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I <br/></span>
shall have somebody to talk to.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was <br/></span>
mouth enough for it to speak with.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and <br/></span>
no more of it appeared.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in <br/></span>
 at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and <br/>
you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;
for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next <br/>
walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it <br/></span>
saw mine coming!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while <br/></span>
finishing the game.' <br/>
 <br/>
  The Queen smiled and passed on.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me <br/></span>
to introduce it.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.</span>
 <br/>
  `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.
some book, but I don't remember where.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!</span>
wish you would have this cat removed!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great <br/></span>
  `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking <br/>
round.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and <br/></span>
he hurried off.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, <br/></span>
  She had already heard her sentence three <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and <br/></span>
she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or <br/></span>
  So she went in search of her hedgehog.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one <br/></span>
of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up <br/></span>
into a tree.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, <br/></span>
the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>are gone from this side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away <br/></span>
under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for <br/>
a little more conversation with her friend.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who <br/></span>
were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, <br/>
and looked very uncomfortable.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed <br/></span>
to make out exactly what they said.
 <br/>
  The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a <br/>
head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had <br/>
never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin <br/>
at HIS time of life.
 <br/>
  The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be <br/>
beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.
 <br/>
  The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about <br/>
it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so <br/></span>
grave and anxious.) <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Duchess:  you'd better ask HER about it.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner:  `fetch <br/></span>
her here.'  And the executioner went off like an arrow.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>   The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely <br/></span>
 so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</span>
 <br/>

                           CHAPTER IX <br/>
 <br/>
                     The Mock Turtle's Story <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately <br/></span>
into Alice's, and they walked off together.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and <br/></span>
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had <br/>
made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.
 <br/>
  `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT <br/></span>
  Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar <br/></span>
and such things that make children sweet-tempered.
people knew that:  then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you <br/>
know--' <br/>
 <br/>
  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you <br/></span>
  I can't tell you just now what the moral of that <br/>
is, but I shall remember it in a bit.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.</span>
 <br/>
  `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>moral, if only you can find it.'  And she squeezed herself up <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</span>
 <br/>
  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first, <br/>
because the Duchess was VERY ugly;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, <br/></span>
and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.
like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of <br/></span>
keeping up the conversation a little.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `'Tis so,' said the Duchess:  `and the moral of that is--"Oh, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody <br/></span>
minding their own business!' <br/>
 <br/>
  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>sounds will take care of themselves."' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to <br/></span>
herself.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>waist,' the Duchess said after a pause:  `the reason is, that I'm <br/></span>
doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.
experiment?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all <br/></span>
anxious to have the experiment tried.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Very true,' said the Duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard both <br/></span>
  And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock <br/>
together."' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess:  `what a clear way you <br/></span>
have of putting things!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree <br/></span>
 `there's a large mustard-mine near <br/>
  And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the <br/>
less there is of yours."' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this <br/></span>
last remark, `it's a vegetable.
is.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than <br/></span>
what it might appear to others that what you were or might have <br/>
been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared <br/>
to them to be otherwise."' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>politely, `if I had it written down:  but I can't quite follow it <br/></span>
as you say it.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess <br/>
replied, in a pleased tone.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' <br/></span>
said Alice.
 <br/>
  `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess.
a present of everything I've said as yet.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>give birthday presents like that!'  But she did not venture to <br/></span>
say it out loud.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her <br/></span>
sharp little chin.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>beginning to feel a little worried.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;</span>
and the m--' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the <br/></span>
arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, <br/></span>
frowning like a thunderstorm.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak <br/></span>
voice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on <br/></span>
the ground as she spoke;
and that in about half no time!
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her <br/></span>
back to the croquet-ground.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>moment's delay would cost them their lives.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  All the time they were playing the Queen never left off <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>head!' or `Off with her head!'  Those whom she sentenced were <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour <br/></span>
or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of <br/></span>
execution.
 <br/>
  Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his <br/></span>
history,' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.'  `Come, <br/></span>
THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the <br/></span>
  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to <br/></span>
see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.
see after some executions I have ordered';
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage <br/></span>
Queen:  so she waited.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the <br/></span>
Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</span>
 <br/>
  `What IS the fun?' said Alice.
 <br/>
  `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.
never executes nobody, you know.
 <br/>
  `Everybody says "come on!"
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life, <br/></span>
never!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart <br/></span>
  `What is his sorrow?' she <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the <br/></span>
same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got <br/>
no sorrow, you know.
 <br/>
  So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to <br/></span>
know your history, she do.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've <br/></span>
finished.' <br/>
 <br/>
  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he <br/></span>
doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was <br/></span>
a real Turtle.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and <br/></span>
the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be <br/></span>
more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to <br/></span>
  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call <br/>
him Tortoise--' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Turtle angrily:  `really you are very dull!' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple <br/></span>
question,' added the Gryphon;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!</span>
Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words: <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe <br/></span>
it--' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.</span>
 <br/>
  `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak <br/></span>
  The Mock Turtle went on.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school <br/></span>
every day--' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice;
so proud as all that.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.</span>
 <br/>
 then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock <br/>
Turtle in a tone of great relief.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice;
bottom of the sea.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a <br/></span>
  `I only took the regular course.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What was that?' inquired Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock <br/></span>
 `and then the different branches of Arithmetic-- <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say.
 <br/>
  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.
heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed.
I suppose?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to <br/></span>
uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you <br/></span>
to learn?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>with Seaography:  then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>conger-eel, that used to come once a week:  HE taught us <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `What was THAT like?' said Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said:  `I'm <br/></span>
  And the Gryphon never learnt it.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon:  `I went to the Classics <br/></span>
  He was an old crab, HE was.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh:  `he <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a <br/></span>
hurry to change the subject.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the <br/></span>
next, and so on.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>remarked:  `because they lessen from day to day.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a <br/></span>
  `Then the eleventh day <br/>
must have been a holiday?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>very decided tone:  `tell her something about the games now.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
                            CHAPTER X <br/>
 <br/>
                      The Lobster Quadrille <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper <br/></span>
  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for <br/>
a minute or two sobs choked his voice.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>in his throat,' said the Gryphon:  and it set to work shaking him <br/></span>
  At last the Mock Turtle recovered <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on <br/></span>
again:-- <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)-- <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--' <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful <br/></span>
thing a Lobster Quadrille is!' <br/>
 <br/>
  `What sort of a dance is it?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle.</span>
then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.</span>
 <br/>
  `--you advance twice--' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said:  `advance twice, set to <br/></span>
partners--' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the <br/></span>
Gryphon.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `--as far out to sea as you can--' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, <br/></span>
capering wildly about.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</span>
 <br/>
  `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the <br/>
Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.</span>
 <br/>
  `Very much indeed,' said Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the <br/></span>
  `We can do without lobsters, you know.
sing?' <br/>
 <br/>
  `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle <br/></span>
sang this, very slowly and sadly:-- <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
`"Will you walk a little faster?"
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my <br/></span>
 tail.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the <br/></span>
dance?
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the <br/></span>
dance?
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the <br/></span>
dance?
 <br/>
 <br/>
"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be <br/>
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to <br/>
                                                      sea!"
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>But the snail replied "Too far, too far!"</span>
                                                       askance-- <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the <br/></span>
   dance.
    Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join <br/>
        the dance.
    Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join <br/>
        the dance.
 <br/>
`"What matters it how far we go?"
"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>The further off from England the nearer is to France-- <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the <br/></span>
         dance?
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the <br/></span>
         dance?"' <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last:  `and I do so <br/></span>
like that curious song about the whiting!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've <br/></span>
seen them, of course?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she <br/></span>
checked herself hastily.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but <br/></span>
if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're <br/>
like.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.
tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: <br/></span>
`crumbs would all wash off in the sea.
 and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all <br/></span>
that,' he said to the Gryphon.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with <br/></span>
the lobsters to the dance.
they had to fall a long way.
their mouths.
  That's all.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting.
so much about a whiting before.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the <br/>
  `Do you know why it's called a whiting?' <br/>
 <br/>
  `I never thought about it,' said Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very <br/></span>
solemnly.
 <br/>
  Alice was thoroughly puzzled.
repeated in a wondering tone.
 <br/>
  `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon.
mean, what makes them so shiny?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she <br/></span>
  `They're done with blacking, I believe.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep <br/></span>
voice, `are done with a whiting.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great <br/></span>
curiosity.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>impatiently:  `any shrimp could have told you that.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep <br/></span>
back, please:  we don't want YOU with us!"' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>said:  `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle:  `why, if a fish came <br/></span>
to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With <br/>
what porpoise?"' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended <br/></span>
  And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR <br/>
adventures.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>said Alice a little timidly:  `but it's no use going back to <br/></span>
yesterday, because I was a different person then.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.
 <br/>
  The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>impatient tone:  `explanations take such a dreadful time.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when <br/></span>
she first saw the White Rabbit.
it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she <br/></span>
gained courage as she went on.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said <br/></span>
`That's very curious.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated <br/></span>
  `I should like to hear her try and repeat <br/>
  Tell her to begin.'  He looked at the Gryphon as <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said <br/></span>
the Gryphon.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat <br/></span>
lessons!' thought Alice;
 `I might as well be at school at once.' <br/>
However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>saying, and the words came very queer indeed:-- <br/></span>
 <br/>
    `'Tis the voice of the Lobster;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."</span>
    As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>              [later editions continued as follows <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark, <br/></span>
    But, when the tide rises and sharks are around, <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.] <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,' <br/>
said the Gryphon.
 <br/>
  `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle;
sounds uncommon nonsense.' <br/>
 <br/>
 she had sat down with her face in her <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way <br/></span>
again.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.</span>
 <br/>
  `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily.
the next verse.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted.
he turn them out with his nose, you know?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the <br/></span>
subject.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`it begins "I passed by his garden."' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:-- <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>        [later editions continued as follows <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl, <br/></span>
    And concluded the banquet--] <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle <br/></span>
interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on?
the most confusing thing I ever heard!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon:  and <br/></span>
Alice was only too glad to do so.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the <br/></span>
  `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you <br/>
a song?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather <br/></span>
offended tone, `Hm!
  No accounting for tastes!
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>choked with sobs, to sing this:-- <br/></span>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green, <br/></span>
    Waiting in a hot tureen!
    Who for such dainties would not stoop?
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</span>
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>        Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</span>
 <br/>
    `Beautiful Soup!
    Game, or any other dish?
    Who would not give all else for two <br/>
    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, <br/>
        Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!' <br/></span>
was heard in the distance.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the <br/></span>
melancholy words:-- <br/>
 <br/>
    `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>        Beautiful, beautiful Soup!' <br/></span>

                      Who Stole the Tarts?
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on <br/></span>
 and near the King was the White Rabbit, <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the <br/></span>
  In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,' <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!'  But there seemed <br/></span>
to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about <br/>
her, to pass away the time.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that <br/></span>
she knew the name of nearly everything there.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  The judge, by the way, was the King;
over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly <br/></span>
not becoming.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve <br/></span>
creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>are the jurors.'  She said this last word two or three times over <br/></span>
to herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the <br/></span>
meaning of it at all.
as well.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.</span>
`What are they doing?'  Alice whispered to the Gryphon.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the <br/></span>
trial.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked <br/></span>
anxiously round, to make out who was talking.
 <br/>
  Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!' <br/></span>
on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his <br/></span>
  `A nice muddle their slates'll be in <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</span>
 <br/>
  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it <br/></span>
  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was <br/>
Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of <br/>
 so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write <br/>
with one finger for the rest of the day;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:-- <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>    `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, <br/></span>
          All on a summer day: <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>      The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, <br/></span>
          And took them quite away!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.</span>
 <br/>
  `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a great deal to come before that!' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `Call the first witness,' said the King;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First <br/></span>
witness!' <br/>
 <br/>
  The first witness was the Hatter.
one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in:  but I <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `You ought to have finished,' said the King.
begin?' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into <br/></span>
the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.
think it was,' he said.
 <br/>
  `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.
 <br/>
  `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.</span>
 <br/>
  `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who <br/></span>
instantly made a memorandum of the fact.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;</span>
`I've none of my own.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.</span>
 <br/>
  `Give your evidence,' said the King;
I'll have you executed on the spot.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all:  he kept <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his <br/></span>
teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which <br/></span>
puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was:  she was <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she <br/></span>
would get up and leave the court;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for <br/></span>
her.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was <br/></span>
  `I can hardly breathe.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly:  `you know <br/></span>
you're growing too.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`not in that ridiculous fashion.'  And he got up very sulkily <br/></span>
and crossed over to the other side of the court.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter <br/></span>
trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>you executed, whether you're nervous or not.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and <br/></span>
the twinkling of the tea--' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.</span>
`Do you take me for a dunce?
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.</span>
 <br/>
  `You did!' said the Hatter.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I deny it!' said the March Hare.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `He denies it,' said the King:  `leave out that part.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:  but the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread- <br/></span>
and-butter--' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you <br/></span>
executed.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, <br/></span>
  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he <br/>
began.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately <br/></span>
suppressed by the officers of the court.
hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat <br/></span>
upon it.) <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant <br/></span>
till now.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' <br/>
continued the King.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter:  `I'm on the floor, as <br/></span>
it is.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</span>
 <br/>
  `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.
shall get on better.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one <br/></span>
of the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before the <br/>
officer could get to the door.
 <br/>
  `Call the next witness!' said the King.
 <br/>
  The next witness was the Duchess's cook.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began <br/></span>
sneezing all at once.
 <br/>
  `Give your evidence,' said the King.
 <br/>
  `Shan't,' said the cook.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What <br/></span>
are tarts made of?' <br/>
 <br/>
  `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.</span>
 <br/>
  `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.
  Turn that Dormouse out of court!
  Off with his whiskers!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down <br/></span>
again, the cook had disappeared.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Call the next witness.'  And he added in an undertone to the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.</span>
It quite makes my forehead ache!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, <br/></span>
feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, <br/>
`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!' <br/></span>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
                           CHAPTER XII <br/>
 <br/>
                        Alice's Evidence <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset <br/></span>
the week before.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places-- <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as <br/></span>
he said do.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable <br/></span>
  She soon got it out again, and put it right;
it signifies much,' she said to herself;
would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, <br/></span>
gazing up into the roof of the court.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `What do you know about this business?' the King said to <br/></span>
Alice.
 <br/>
  `Nothing,' said Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.</span>
 <br/>
  `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.</span>
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant, your Majesty means, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and <br/></span>
making faces at him as he spoke.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and <br/></span>
went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant-- <br/>
unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word <br/>
sounded best.
 <br/>
  Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some <br/>
`unimportant.'  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to <br/>
 `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she <br/>
thought to herself.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out <br/></span>
from his book, `Rule Forty-two.
HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.' <br/>
 <br/>
  Everybody looked at Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.</span>
 <br/>
  `You are,' said the King.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice:  `besides, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>that's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.</span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling <br/></span>
voice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said <br/></span>
the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry;
just been picked up.' <br/>
 <br/>
  `What's in it?' said the Queen.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was <br/>
written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.</span>
 <br/>
  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set <br/></span>
of verses.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of <br/></span>
the jurymen.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.) <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.</span>
(The jury all brightened up again.) <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the <br/></span>
  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>have signed your name like an honest man.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the <br/>
first really clever thing the King had said that day.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.</span>
 <br/>
  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.
even know what they're about!' <br/>
 <br/>
  `Read them,' said the King.
 <br/>
  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.
please your Majesty?' he asked.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>till you come to the end:  then stop.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:-- <br/></span>
 <br/>
        `They told me you had been to her, <br/>
          And mentioned me to him: <br/>
        She gave me a good character, <br/>
          But said I could not swim.
 <br/>
        He sent them word I had not gone <br/>
          (We know it to be true): <br/>
        If she should push the matter on, <br/>
          What would become of you?
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>        I gave her one, they gave him two, <br/></span>
          You gave us three or more;
        They all returned from him to you, <br/>
          Though they were mine before.
 <br/>
        If I or she should chance to be <br/>
          Involved in this affair, <br/>
        He trusts to you to set them free, <br/>
          Exactly as we were.
 <br/>
        My notion was that you had been <br/>
          (Before she had this fit) <br/>
        An obstacle that came between <br/>
          Him, and ourselves, and it.
 <br/>
        Don't let him know she liked them best, <br/>
          For this must ever be <br/>
        A secret, kept from all the rest, <br/>
          Between yourself and me.' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' <br/></span>
said the King, rubbing his hands;
 <br/>
  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>believe there's an atom of meaning in it.' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to <br/></span>
explain the paper.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.</span>
yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his <br/>
knee, and looking at them with one eye;
meaning in them, after all.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.</span>
 <br/>
  The Knave shook his head sadly.
(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.) <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why, <br/></span>
that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--' <br/>
 <br/>
  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said <br/>
Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to <br/></span>
the tarts on the table.
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my <br/></span>
dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the <br/></span>
  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no <br/></span>
 but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.) <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round <br/></span>
the court with a smile.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</span>
 <br/>
  `No, no!' said the Queen.
 <br/>
  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.
the sentence first!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.</span>
 <br/>
  `I won't!' said Alice.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.</span>
Nobody moved.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!' <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the <br/></span>
trees upon her face.
 <br/>
  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister;
sleep you've had!' <br/>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told <br/></span>
her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange <br/>
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about;
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she <br/></span>
ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- <br/></span>
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back <br/></span>
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>around her became alive the strange creatures of her little <br/></span>
sister's dream.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable <br/></span>
Mock Turtle.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep- <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's <br/></span>
heavy sobs.
 <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman;</span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager <br/></span>
with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of <br/>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, <br/></span>
<span class='highlighted' style='background: #fff2a8;'>remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</span>
 <br/>
